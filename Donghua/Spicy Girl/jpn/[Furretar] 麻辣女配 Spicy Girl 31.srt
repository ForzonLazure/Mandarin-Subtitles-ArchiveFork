Su Xiao! Get up! Su Xiao!

33
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,540
What's up? What happened?

34
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,700
It's a storm! Too dangerous here!

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,860
We have to go up!

36
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,520
Are you kidding?

37
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,090
Hurry, get up!

38
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,150
Sorry.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,730
Maybe because I was too tired,
I slept like a log.

40
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,400
It's my fault.

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,690
I shouldn't have
put up tents on the beach.

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,940
But you did that to...

43
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,580
Don't know how severe the storm would be.

44
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,190
Let's go hide in the cave
that we saw in the daytime.

45
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,740
Okay.

46
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,060
This...

47
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,270
The boards have been blown away.

48
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,270
What should we do?

49
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,310
Watch out!

50
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,230
Come!

51
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,249
But I...

52
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,400
Hurry, hold my hand!

53
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,180
I...

54
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:31,809
Su Xiao!

55
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,430
Don't be afraid. Trust me.

56
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,209
Let's go.

57
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,010
Okay.

58
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,440
This is not arranged by them, right?

59
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,160
You think they
got the Rain God to do this?

60
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,880
Sandy must be so worried about us.

61
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,590
I don't think
they could come here before it's fine.

62
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,920
At present, we have to rely on ourselves.

63
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,870
Are you okay?

64
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,690
What's up?

65
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,980
Nothing...

66
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,270
Well...

67
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,800
Your clothes...

68
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,420
My clothes?

69
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,390
I go check outside.

70
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,690
You just stay here.

71
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,010
Oh.

72
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,380
Are you alright?

73
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,890
Where have you been?

74
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,980
I tore off all the cameras.

75
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,240
Ah, why did you...

76
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,470
You want to be filmed like this?

77
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,820
Don't worry.

78
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,270
I've left a message before the cameras.

79
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,890
Can they see it?

80
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,650
Even if they can't,

81
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,100
they'll come here to investigate.

82
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,869
Anyway, we should find a way to warm up.

83
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,590
You're right.

84
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,440
Luckily, I've brought a lighter.

85
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,480
Now the problem is
to find something to burn.

86
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,569
I'll go pick up
some twigs from outside, wait for me.

87
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,600
No, you can't go out.

88
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,060
It's okay.

89
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,810
If anything bad happens,
you can rescue me.

90
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,050
It'll be too late by then.

91
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,930
Leave it to me.

92
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,570
Then try to find those dry twigs.

93
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:43,900
Okay.

94
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,269
Sorry, it took a long time.

95
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,860
Although I picked up so much,
it's all wet.

96
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,320
Probably can't be lit.

97
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,949
It's okay. Thank you.

98
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,810
Look.

99
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,540
Although the surface iswet,
they're dry inside.

100
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,540
You also learned this from your father?

101
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,770
Um, yes.

102
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,420
Great!

103
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,520
Now we can survive the night.

104
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,310
We're finally warm.

105
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,440
Seems that you can
have another image, Bear Grylls.

106
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,180
Actually, camping with my dad

107
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,590
didn't always give me happy memories.

108
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,710
You don't like camping?

109
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,440
I was quite happy at first.

110
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,650
I looked ferocious.
Other kids often got scared.

111
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,690
So I couldn't make any friends.

112
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,650
Then I became reluctant to play outside.

113
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,790
On festivals or holidays,

114
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,649
other kids all played outside home.

115
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,070
Only I stayed in my room in a daze.

116
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,350
But one day,

117
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,660
I overheard that

118
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,900
the reason why dad took me to camp

119
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,899
was that he thought it's pitiful to see me

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
staying alone...

121
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,060
I didn't like to show
my true feelings back then.

122
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,180
So I had a fight with him.

123
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,250
Since then, I stopped go camping.

124
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,870
Didn't expect what I learned back then

125
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,529
could be so useful today.

126
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,450
Your father actually
treated you very well.

127
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,270
Um.

128
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,760
You've been caring about
your look since then?

129
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,230
Um.

130
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,530
But actually I just felt like

131
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,690
that it's my own problem.

132
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,540
I didn't want to
rely on my family to solve it.

133
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,280
I wanted to find
a road that belongs to myself.

134
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,680
A road that I could walk down

135
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,200
till its end regardless of this look.

136
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,720
So you became an actress?

137
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,900
Um.

138
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,870
But I can never
say sorry to my father any more.

139
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,270
You can't?

140
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,880
Your father must be
protecting you from far away.

141
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:53,959
Um.

142
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,460
Let's go visit his grave after going back.

143
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,540
His... His grave?

144
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,770
Your father's.

145
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,899
When did my father get a grave?

146
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,759
He didn't...

147
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,810
Of course, he's still alive.

148
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,560
He's... Alive?

149
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,980
He's well alive.

150
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,080
He watches my TV shows
every day back in my hometown.

151
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,170
He's so happy.

152
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,519
But you just said you can't apologize?

153
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,740
Missed the best timing.
How embarrassing if I apologize now!

154
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,510
Well, don't pretend to be strong.

155
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,530
What, you want my dad to be dead?

156
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,829
No. But you... Your emotion just now...

157
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,740
I said he's alive.
Why are you so annoying?

158
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,370
We're not in some romance drama now.

159
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,210
We're in the reality, reality, you know?

160
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,590
Did your IQ get lowered by those plays?

161
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,480
How can we encounter those absurd plots?

162
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,210
You silly cat.

163
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,350
You didn't say it clearly!

164
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,380
What are you doing, freak!

165
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,810
