00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,830
Sign with you?

32
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,080
Are you also intended to take advantage of me?

33
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,710
Your appearance holds no appeal to me.

34
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,420
You don't have to say it so directly!

35
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,380
If you refuse,

36
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,379
I'll cancel all the investment
in director Gao at once!

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,010
And I'll put the photo of you two
on the headlines of entertainment news

38
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,430
to expose the backstage deal
between director Gao and an actress.

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,260
No! Please spare me, boss Xiao!

40
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,389
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

41
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,690
People already find me vicious-looking now.

42
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,770
If I'm involved in that kind of news,

43
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,900
the image of me in audience's mind

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,690
will never be able to make a turnaround.

45
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,150
Who will let me play positive roles then?

46
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,030
I...

47
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,570
Fine.

48
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,910
Then tell me, what's the contract about?

49
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:10,950
Director Gao.

50
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,330
Could you please chill
yourself down outside the room?

51
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,459
Okay. I do feel a little hot now.

52
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,050
How come he runs away so fast.

53
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,300
You...What are you doing?

54
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,470
Okay.

55
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,010
Next I'll tell you about the contract.

56
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,970
Go ahead.

57
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,719
Three articles in the contract.

58
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,560
Firstly,

59
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,060
I'll manage your work in the showbiz exclusively.

60
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,899
I'll introduce to you whatever
resources you want.

61
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,070
I guess,

62
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,820
even if you struggle like this for decades,

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,610
you can never get such resources.

64
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:48,990
Secondly,

65
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,790
you must accept any requirement I ask

66
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,460
to the extent permitted by law.

67
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,540
What requirement?

68
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,830
I'll tell you the details later.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
At last,

70
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,130
during the term of the contract,

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
you also work as my personal assistant.

72
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,880
What?! What did you say?

73
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,890
That's all.

74
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,929
Why should you ask me to be your assistant?

75
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,270
I'm an actress, not a baby-sitter.

76
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,810
To ensure that you can assist me well,

77
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,390
I'll arrange a new dorm for you,

78
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,809
right upstairs my room.

79
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,610
The contract is so weird!

80
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,530
Don't you want to have better
development in the showbiz?

81
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,150
Listen to this again,

82
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,240
I promise that I won't ask for
any illegal requirement.

83
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,490
What should I do?

84
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,490
With better connections from the Movie King,

85
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,959
I'll surely get many jobs better than I have.

86
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,710
But the studio that I'm signing
with has been treating me well.

87
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,300
If I dump them for this reason,

88
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:40,030
I...

89
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,090
My requirement is,

90
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,970
put this on!

91
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,810
What's this?

92
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,100
When I ask you to wear this,

93
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,560
you must do as I say.

94
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:57,899
Huh?

95
00:03:59,179 --> 00:03:59,653
Freak!

96
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:01,055
A sheer freak!

97
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,110
A national-level freak!

98
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,730
What do you say?

99
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,110
A good deal, isn't it?

100
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,399
Are you kidding me?!

101
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,779
Aren't you an idiot?!

102
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,410
Who will sign such a contract?!

103
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,660
Even without you,

104
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,200
my studio will try their best to get jobs for me!

105
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,330
If you spread rumors,

106
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,540
they'll also solve it for me!

107
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,170
Although it's just an unknown studio,

108
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,210
we have team spirit and we'll work really hard!

109
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,170
Who do you think you are?

110
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,500
The Movie King can always get his own way?

111
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,310
Put this on!

112
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,690
You wish.

113
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,990
What a coincidence.

114
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,280
Not take this one?

115
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,580
What... What should I do?

116
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,329
If I take the lift with this
national-level freak alone...

117
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,210
You're not gonna take this one?

118
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,670
Why do I have to avoid this?

119
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,300
What's to be afraid of?

120
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,210
Your face...

121
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,760
So terrible.

122
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:13,425
About the cat outfit,

123
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:14,537
you might have misunderstood me.

124
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,430
If I tell you that

125
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,180
it's because I'm gonna shoot a work
about a pet cat turning into a human,

126
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:20,899
and I need someone to help me figure out

127
00:05:21,257 --> 00:05:23,519
how to imitate and show the cat's body language.

128
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,810
Will you accept to sign with me?

129
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,952
You didn't explain it earlier but now.

130
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:32,069
You think I'll believe you?

131
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:32,754
Who knows

132
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:35,329
if you just made it up to cheat me.

133
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:35,756
Makes sense.

134
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:36,990
It's up to you then.

135
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,793
But you're really suitable for this job.

136
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:39,761
What a pity.

137
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,013
If you want to sign with me,

138
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,255
you may come to me at any time.

139
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:45,500
Bye-bye.

140
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,163
Are you kidding me?

141
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:47,889
You freak,

142
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:48,590
I won't...

143
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,090
I won't sign that damn contract!

144
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,180
=Beauty Studio=

145
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,680
Su Xiao.

146
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,310
Su Xiao, good morning.

147
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:03,457
What

148
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:04,650
are you doing?

149
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,980
Sorry, Su Xiao.

150
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,110
Our studio only has one actress, you.

151
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,424
For you, we had to find resources,

152
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:11,209
sponsors,

153
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:12,570
and stylists.

154
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,450
But your rewards were so little.

155
00:06:14,586 --> 00:06:15,068
So,

156
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:16,410
we just settled accounts.

157
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:17,628
From tomorrow on,

158
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:18,700
we close down.

159
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:19,712
What?!

160
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,000
How could it turn into this?

161
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:22,851
Fine.

162
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,588
Isn't it just a contract?

163
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:25,710
I'll sign it!

164
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:26,971
As long as I can still be an actress,

165
00:06:27,034 --> 00:06:28,460
I'll accept whatever requirement!

166
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:29,782
Wait for me.

167
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,129
