It's Sis Sandy.

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,920
Time for director Xu's audition is settled.

=The audition starts tomorrow noon.
I'll pick you up there. Get ready=

00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,720
Tomorrow?

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,010
Audition...

37
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,550
For which scene? The first one?

38
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,640
What should I do? I haven't recited the lines.

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,760
Come to my room later.

40
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,680
Didn't you hear what I said?

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,060
I have no time to play the cat game with you!

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,310
You think I'm kidding?

43
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,690
I have something serious to tell you.

44
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,480
I don't want you to be a stupid cat

45
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,150
and get shamefully nervous just for an audition.

46
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,610
Don't be nervous.

47
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,700
It's just an audition.

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,710
By the way,

49
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:05,620
it's said that the leading
actress is also settled.

50
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,120
She'll come here as well.

51
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,240
Oh, really?

52
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,040
A very famous actress.

53
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,410
Guess, who is she?

54
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,290
Oh, really?

55
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,800
Su Xiao!

56
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,866
You're here!

57
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:18,340
Su Xiao.

58
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,066
Seeing me here,

59
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:20,200
don't you feel surprised?

60
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:22,422
Actually it's director Xu
who told me to come help him.

61
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:23,399
Unexpected, right?

62
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,622
So,

63
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,088
I'm here.

64
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:26,622
Doesn't it make you extremely happy?

65
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:29,777
Sorry, director Gao.

66
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:31,600
She's just too nervous.

69
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,800
Later,

70
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,820
when director Xiao is here,

71
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,240
let's start the audition from Su Xiao.

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,570
I'm the first?

73
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,444
Help. Help.

74
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,119
I can't mess it up.

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,911
But,

76
00:02:50,022 --> 00:02:51,500
why that girl

77
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,870
keeps staring at me?

78
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,330
Hi, everyone.

79
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,600
Excuse me.

80
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:57,790
I'm late.

81
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,920
Hi, director Xu.

82
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,066
That is...

83
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:04,760
Director Xu in the flesh?

84
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,310
Damn it.

85
00:03:05,422 --> 00:03:08,680
My hands are trembling. What to do?

86
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,060
I don't have time to play this with you now!

87
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,230
I'm gonna meet director Xu tomorrow.

88
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,480
Director Xu?

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,649
He likes eating stinky tofu.

90
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,480
Although teased by the crew,

91
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,110
he still sneaks out to eat it.

92
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,650
You got to observe carefully.

93
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,490
If he keeps drinking,

94
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,820
that means he just ate some in private.

95
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,570
Why he has to keep drinking?

96
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,619
Isn't it obvious?

97
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,830
His mouth stinks too much.

98
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,120
Drinking stops him from being
disliked by actors and the crew.

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,210
How can that be possible? I don't believe you.

100
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,790
You'll know it by then.

101
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,709
Director Xu is so otherworldly, how could he...

102
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,300
He is!

103
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,050
He keeps drinking!

104
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:47,711
He really

105
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,243
just ate stinky tofu!

106
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,888
That freak

107
00:03:54,288 --> 00:03:55,100
was telling the truth?

108
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,980
You got to observe carefully.

109
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,770
If he keeps drinking,

110
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,020
that means he just ate some in private.

111
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,980
No trembling now.

112
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,900
Or he said that to save me from being nervous?

113
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,110
How is that possible?

114
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,700
I must over-interpret it.

115
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,155
Okay.

116
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,580
Let's begin the audition.

117
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,040
Okay.

118
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:15,977
Director.

119
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,290
What about the leading actress?

120
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,749
She said that she's in a traffic jam.
She's still not here.

121
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:20,459
I got this!

122
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,540
Don't worry.

123
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,822
With me being your partner,

124
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:25,590
you'll give full play to your real strength!

125
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,460
Director, what should we do?

126
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,088
It's okay.

127
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:28,470
We're testing Su Xiao anyway.

128
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,340
Let him be.

129
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:34,800
Okay.

130
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,666
Ready?

131
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:36,711
Action.

132
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,530
I didn't expect that you're this kind of person.

133
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,933
Miss, you're really

134
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:51,490
as beautiful as a flower.

135
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,330
I think even if you're dead,

136
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,120
you can still be a beauty.

137
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,120
Since you're in so much pain,

138
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,620
let me make it easier for you!

139
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,844
In this world,

140
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:05,400
how could I be the only one

141
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
who're made so painful?

142
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,155
Okay.

143
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,510
Done.

144
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,300
Very good. Very good.

145
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,720
Thank you, director.

146
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,310
You still need to mind the details.

147
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,020
But generally, you fit the role.

148
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,220
Su... Su Xiao. Let go.

149
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,844
Sorry.

150
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,900
I'm late.

151
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,422
Li...

152
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:29,030
Li... Li Yan?

153
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,490
This is our leading actress.

154
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,043
Hi, director.

155
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,266
Hi, everyone.

156
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,079
The leading actress is Li Yan?

157
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,711
Okay.

158
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:37,990
Everyone is here.

159
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,666
So, let's

160
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,370
continue the audition.

161
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,040
Okay.

162
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,022
The next one is

163
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:42,920
Liu Xuxu.

164
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,420
Yes, I'm ready.

165
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,380
Thank you, everyone.

166
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,880
Thank you.

168
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:53,590
Why didn't you tell me
that the leading actress is Li Yan?

169
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,889
I wanted to.

170
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,600
But you just ignored me.

171
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,060
I didn't expect that
I could work with Li Yan so soon.

172
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,140
Ah, I'm so...

173
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,019
What's up?

Liu Xuxu.

176
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,240
She's pretty popular lately.

178
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:15,240
is the investor of this movie.

How could you be here?

183
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,511
Sis Sandy.

184
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,250
You know each other?

185
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,829
Old friends.

186
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,840
You're back again?

187
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,130
I'm still with Xiao Jian.

188

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,759
You stole the supporting role from Xuxu?

192
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,050
How can you say that she stole it?

193
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,680
The director made the decision.

194
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,519
Is that so?

195
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,850
Xiao Jian...

196
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,139
I'm leaving.

197
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,890
Well...

198
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,640
Mr. Li.

199
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:46,170
I will

200
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:48,730
try my best to play the role well.

201
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,807
Then I shall

202
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:53,320
wait and see.

203
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,240
That's what happened?

204
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,200
Really?

205
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,579
Li Yan is really beautiful!

206
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,450
So elegant!

207
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,910
Her face is smaller than that on TV.

208
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,410
So beautiful!

209
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,250
I'm not interested in that.

210
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,459
How about the audition?

211
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,880
Director Xu said that I fit the role well.

212
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,210
But I still need to mind the details.

213
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,265
The scriptwriter also

214
00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:15,590
told me to read the script carefully

215
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,890
to consider the role's inner world.

216
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,563
The scriptwriter?

217
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:20,010
Called Nanshan?

218
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,010
What's the matter?

219
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,970
Nanshan can't behave himself after drinking.

220
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,560
He even stripteases when he's drunk.

221
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,094
What?

222
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:25,850
How is that possible?

223
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,560
The scriptwriter looks very literary.

224
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,400
Look at this.

225
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,520
Even women's wear.

226
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,530
Made of chiffon.

227
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,887
My god.

228
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:35,740
I thought he's refined in manner.

229
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,650
And this...

230
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,050
So unexpected.

231
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:41,740
This is so...

232
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,490
What's up?

233
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,699
I... Well...

234
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,660
Well...

235
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:47,887
This time,

236
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,290
Thank... Thank you.

237
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,840
Or I wouldn't have taken this role.

238
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,087
Your favor...

239
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,112
Your favor is beyond words to return.
