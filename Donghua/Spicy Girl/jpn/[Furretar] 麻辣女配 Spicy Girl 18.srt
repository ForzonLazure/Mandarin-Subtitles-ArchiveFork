=Episode 18=

31
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,520
Oh? She gave that assistant a fright?

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,770
Yep. That assistant was
too frightened to speak.

33
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,600
I can imagine that.

34
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,200
However, she's just so softhearted.

35
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,060
Anyhow, be more careful.

36
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,830
Then with the increase of her popularity,

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,389
there would be more and more
ill-intentioned people approaching her.

38
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,430
Yep. Real troubles
are ahead waiting for us.

39
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,790
Never mind. She won't be
struck down that easily.

40
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,030
Yixiao!

41
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,779
How did you get hurt so badly!

42
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,070
Sis. Take my head back.

43
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,559
You'll get Shifu's trust.

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,420
No, Yixiao, why have to do this?

45
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,780
Finally... I finally...

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,189
Finally help you once.

47
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,090
Yixiao, no.

48
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,700
Yixiao!

49
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,080
Cut! Okay. Done.

50
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,770
Sis Yan, this take is done.

51
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,450
No, I won't let go.

52
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,850
Otherwise, you'll finish all your scenes.

53
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,860
Then how can I eat the meals you cook!

54
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,300
You okay, sis Yan?

55
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,439
Just kidding.
You did really well just now.

56
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,470
Well done.

57
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,980
Okay, all confirmed!

58
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,130
Let's congratulate Su Xiao
on finishing her first movie!

59
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,810
Thank you all for your hard work!

60
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,200
Well done!

61
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,730
So nice!

62
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,480
Good job!

63
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,310
Su Xiao, well done.

64
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,400
Good job.

65
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,279
Thank you.

66
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,460
This film is gonna make a hit.

67
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,340
Keep going. I have faith in you.

68
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,460
Thank you, director. Many thanks.

69
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,170
Thank you all for your hard work.

70
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,310
Okay, save these holiday words.

71
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,150
Just enjoy yourselves!

72
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,950
Cheers!

73
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,920
Cheers!

74
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,620
Send this to that guy.

75
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,360
Su Xiao!

76
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,730
Marry me, okay?

77
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,670
Ah. My girl.

78
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,860
Holds her liquor worse and worse.

79
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,240
Oh, no! I wanna be with Xiaoxiao tomorrow!

80
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,410
I wanna eat dishes she cooks!

81
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,410
I know that. I know.

82
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,240
I'll cook you a meal next time, okay?

83
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,980
To be honest,
I've got a lot of help this time.

84
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,640
Thank you, Sandy.

85
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,640
I would never find Yao Mengfang

86
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,769
was behind this without your help.

87
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,060
I wouldn't have found this on my own.

88
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,390
I heard that he was going to
see Xiao Jian.

89
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,230
What the hell are they doing so covertly?

90
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,940
Could it be...

91
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,460
Seems I'm kinda drunk.

92
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,260
Congratulations on finishing your scenes.

93
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,009
It's been so long since I left this place!

94
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,079
So, you've taken here as your home?

95
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,240
No! Not like that!

96
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,630
Remember to contact Jianjian.

97
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,670
What are you talking about?

98
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,040
Er... well, I'm Su Xiao.

100
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,410
It's about four o'clock
in the afternoon on my side.

101
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,579
It's still night over your side, right?

102
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,640
You can only hear my message
when you get up, right?

103
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,840
Well, I sent you a photo yesterday.

104
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,060
I've finished my first movie successfully.

105
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,340
And... I wanna tell you...

106
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,850
Good luck to your shooting.

107
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,040
This girl...

108
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,670
Not bad.

109
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,990
Su Xiao. Su Xiao.

110
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,910
I fell asleep?

111
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,570

An invitation to

116
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,060
He called me just now.

117
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,240
And delivered it here.

118
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,090

instructed to invite you.

That's right. The schedule is too tight.

121

Refuse it.
