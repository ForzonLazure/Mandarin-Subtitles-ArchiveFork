Wang Yunlong.

32
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:33,790
People call him Brother Wu.

33
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,790
He was awarded the
Best Supporting Actor of the Gold Crane Award.

34
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,210
And he's been nominated as the
Best Supporting Actor for many major awards.

35
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,920
Camera on!

36
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,340
Camera on!

37
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,603
Ready!

38
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:46,607
Action!

39
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,519
I've told you everything that I know.

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,310
No one else! You have to believe me!

41
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,439
I can swear to god!

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,189
You better be honest.

43
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,070
Stop playing such a trick with me.

44
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,900
If you don't tell the truth,

45
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,700
I'll tell my buddies

46
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,070
to take care of your wife and your kid.

47
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,829
I said no one else!

48
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,329
His performance is different from the script.

49
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,500
Should we stop him?

50
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,710
You may beat me to death.

51
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,709
But don't you hurt my wife and my kid?

52
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,420
Old man, why so hysterical?

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,550
Want me to beat you?

54
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,890
This old stuff, pretending being dead?

55
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,390
It's really none of their business!

56
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,390
I did that alone! I did that alone!

57
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,050
Cut!

58
00:02:39,152 --> 00:02:39,980
Okay!

59
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,360
Brother Wu, are you alright?

60
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,360
No big deal, I'm fine.

61
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,778
Director, it was kind of impromptu.

62
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,660
Will that do?

63
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,780
If not, I can do it again.

64
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,156
No need.

65
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:48,905
It's pretty good.

66
00:02:49,138 --> 00:02:49,580
Right to the point.

67
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,155
Brother Wu.

68
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,040
Your acting also made me excited.

69
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,160
Did I use too much strength?

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,869
It's okay. It's okay.

71
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,369
If not, how can there be the effect?

72
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,443
But,

73
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,630
it depends on the director's consideration.

74
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,425
For a good actor,

75
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,630
whether he's the leading
role or the supporting role,

76
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,301
that he gets to the role's inner world

77
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:05,865
matters the most.

78
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,350
That question again.

79
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,230
You want to be famous

80
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,520
or to be an excellent actress?

81
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,020
I...

82
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,190
I want...

83
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:32,950
Please come in.

84
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,160
Sis Sandy.

85
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,750
Xiao Jian called.

86
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,901
The shooting is delayed.

87
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:39,580
So he'll come back tomorrow morning.

88
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,170
He'll not have supper with us.

89
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:42,960
Got it.

90
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,630
I've heard that.

91
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,607
You saw Brother Wu today.

92
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,007
Didn't you?

93
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,179
Any thought?

94
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,800
I feel so ashamed.

95
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,970
Brother  Wu's acting is so good.

96
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,730
And I kind of figure out

97
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,939
why that freak could be a big star.

98
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,649
Can I also be like them?

99
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,980
No one was born as a big star.

100
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,570
Neither was Xiao Jian.

101
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,341
Cut.

102
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,287
Okay.

103
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,592
Good job.

104
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:14,450
You acted well.

105
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,202
Isn't it?

106
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,710
I think I've made huge progress.

107
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,418
Brother Jian.

108
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:19,710
Next scene is,

109
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,590
you meet your dad on the other
side of the playground,

110
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,590
and then you two have a fight.

111
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,348
The actor asks if you and  director

112
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,120
can rehearse it again?

113
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,800
What do you say?

114
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,374
No need.

115
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:29,800
It's unnecessary.

116
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,090
I've remembered the lines.

117
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,410
Brother Jian.

118
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,970
Will you join the gathering next time?

119
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,621
On which day?

120
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:37,600
If I'm free...

121
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,560
You're Xiao Jian?

122
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,980
Hello. Hello.

123
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm Wang Yunlong.

124
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,607
In this scene,

125
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,070
I play the father.

126
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,860
After the shooting that day,

127
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,740
Jianjian changed, as if he's another man.

128
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,116
He told me

129
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:50,660
after going through that scene,

130
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,910
it's like he couldn't act any more.

131
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,505
Later, he watched that show

132
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,990
for dozens of times.

133
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,329
He asked, Sis Sandy,

134
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,750
am I still too inexperienced?

135
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,250
Really?

136
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,054
To be honest,

137
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,009
I was also given a blow.

138
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,340
Although Xiao Jian was very popular,

139
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,509
when we saw Brother Wu's acting,

140
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,969
we felt like that

141
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,800
we can't be self-complacent.

142
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,930
There's still a long way to go.

143
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,247
So from then on,

144
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,560
we've kept working hard

145
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,730
and make it to today.

146
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,810
After saying so much, I become hungry.

147
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,190
You're also tired, right?

148
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,319
Don't cook then.

149
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,360
I'll call food delivery.

150
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,780
Let me know if you want to eat something.

151
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,740
Sis Sandy.

152
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,819
Thank you.

153
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,540
Just a food delivery.

154
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,080
Don't need to be so grateful.

155
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,500
I want...

156
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,550
To be an excellent actress.

157
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,140
I'm gonna be an excellent actress.

158
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,240
Is he dead?

159
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,450
Alive.

160
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,410
But his eye circles are so dark.

161
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,080
It's a chance to take revenge.

162
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,420
Aren't you somebody?

163
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,232
Movie King.

164
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,170
Big star.

165
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,670
Aren't you ferocious?

166
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,340
Sharp tongue. Freak.

167
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,970
It seems that he's been tired from work.

168
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,600
He took time to take me to see Brother Wu.

169
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,440
I'll become a good actress for you.

170
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,694
So,

171
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:45,545
next,

172
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:46,940
as a reward,

173
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,860
let me poke into your nose.

174
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,533
What?

175
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:54,569
You're in such a hurry

176
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,570
to perform our contract?

177
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,105
You...

178
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:57,530
What are you talking about?

179
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,240
Let me go.

180
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,700
Think about the contract,

181
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,410
and then you'll know what you should do.

182
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,221
First of all,

183
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:05,080
have breakfast.

184
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,458
Come. Come.

185
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,250
This way. This way.

186
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:09,880
Come. Come.

187
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,340
Say meow. Say meow.

188
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,420
This way. This way.

189
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,380
Look. Look.

190
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,390
No one was born as a big star.

191
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,900
