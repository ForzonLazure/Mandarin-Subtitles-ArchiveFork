Xiaoxiao, wait for me here. I go check in.

32
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,380
Thanks, Sis Sandy.

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,999
What the hell is this hotel!
And you let me live in that fucking standard room!

34
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,510
Do you know who I am?

35
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,050
That's...

36
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,800
But deluxe suits are for starring roles.

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,220
Liu Xuxu...

38
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,288
Cut off this shit! I can't live in such a room anyway!

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,310
How could she behave like this?

40
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,400
I have an investor at my back!
Do you wanna get fired?

41
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:51,133
I'm back.

42
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,189
Ms. Liu, we really can't help with this.

43
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,310
What a good place it is!

44
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,279
Never thought we could live in such a nice hotel
shooting on location in the suburbs.

45
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,490
Of course. After all, it's a big-budget movie.

46
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,780
Yes. If someone is still fastidious
staying in such a nice hotel,

47
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,710
why not just back home and play house?

48
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,579
Su Xiao!

49
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,580
Ah, Liu Xuxu, it's you.

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,330
Are you in a meeting?

51
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,670
None of your business.

52
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,920
Hey! Gimme the room key.

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,470
Okay.

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,350
Many thanks.

55
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,770
It's okay. This hotel is indeed nice.

56
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,060
It does look good.

57
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,110
But the rooms are not well insulated.

58
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,190
Ah? I see.

59
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,290
Why my room is next to hers! Pisses me off!

60
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,330
I gotta ask Li Xiwei to change another
room for me when he comes!

61
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,999
What fucking hotel and crew!
How come the director chose her!

62
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:02,177
Well... Indeed not well insulated.

63
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:03,380
Damn it!

64
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,470
Wow! What a beautiful shooting location!

65
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,220
Such fresh air.

66
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,890
It'll be a while before the shooting starts.
Do you wanna put up makeup first?

67
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,890
I'd like to stay here for a while.

68
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,310
All right. Enjoy the scenery here,
and get some feel.

69
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,866
I go get ready with the crew, see you later.

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,288
It's so quiet that I could only
hear the rustle of leaves.

71
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,399
It's rare to be away from the noisy city.

72
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:35,044
Xiaoxiao!

73
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,977
It's amazing. The rustle even made me feel like
someone is calling my name.

74
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,300
Xiaoxiao!

75
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,430
Really sounds like that.
Could it be the fairies of the forest?

76
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,220
Xiaoxiao!

77
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,333
Wait. There's really someone calling me.

78
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,220
It's me! Xiaoxiao!

79
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,150
I've been waiting for you, Xiaoxiao!

80
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,190
Director Gao!

81
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,899
Director Gao, I didn't expect you're also here.

82
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,733
We're sent to find a view in advance.
We've been waiting for you here.

83
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,700
That's so good!

84
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,869
Seeing me makes you that happy?

85
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:19,670
Or do you want me to take advantage of you?

86
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,460
Go to hell!

87
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,510
Just kidding.

88
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,130
I don't wanna hear such kidding.

89
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,180
Xiao Jian is on your side now. How dare I do that?

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,100
Speaking of this, but for me,
how would you have met Xiao Jian.

91
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,230
Exactly.

92
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,230
I heard from Senior Xu that you did a good job.

93
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,740
Seems that being with the movie king does help.

94
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,569
You got improved in acting.

95
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,280
I'm not with him!

96
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,820
Then, what's relationship between you?

97
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,040
Yes... What's our relationship?

98
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,170
Only interests matter between us.

99
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,970
But, why my heart...

100
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,980
Ms. Su, your skin looks so good.

101
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,560
No one has praised me that.

102
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,399
I've been your fan since I saw your last scene.

103
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,690
I'm so lucky to do your makeup.

104
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,160
Ah? Fan? I had no fans before.

105
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,330
Well, I'll be your number-one fan then.
My name is Yao Mengfang.

106
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,250
Okay, ready!

107
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,370
Action!

108
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,340
Go straight along this road and you'll get out.

109
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,839
Sis, why don't you leave with me?

110
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,466
I still got things to do. Don't worry about me. Now go.

111
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,430
Just give it up!

112
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,510
You thought it's so east to run away?

113
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,770
I didn't expect you two are in cahoots.

114
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,310
Yixiao, run!

115
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,240
I promised I would protect her as long as I could!

116
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,250
Cut! Okay.

117
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you for your guidance.

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,800
You're so good at acting at such young age.
Very promising.

119
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,210
No, no, I'm flattered.

120
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,970
You must have learnt a lot, right?

121
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:39,110
Recently, I did find myself many shortcomings,
so when I went back...

122
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,770
Went back?

123
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,190
With the guidance from me,
such a national movie king.

124
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,422
And thanks to me, you can be in this movie.

125
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,360
So when you come back, you've to...

126
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,820
Act as a cat.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,819
A cat? You mean liberating nature? That's basic.

128
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,870
Forget what I said, please!

129
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,000
Er... Okay.

130
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,370
Thank you so much!

131
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:12,710
What are you bullshitting?

132
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,760
Not that!

133
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,050
-Sorry, we gotta go.
-Let me explain it, Sis Sandy!

134
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,430
She is really cute.

135
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,720
