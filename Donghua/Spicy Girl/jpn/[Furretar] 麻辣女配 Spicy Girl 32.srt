00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,830
Why are we fighting again?

32
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,359
It's not appropriate to be
at odds with her right now.

33
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,210
I'd better...

34
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,430
Well, just now...

35
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,900
Don't cross the line, you freak.

36
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,109
You...

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,070
You're a pupil?

38
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,279
Why did you draw a line?

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,129
You're the naive pupil!

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,420
You freak...

41
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,070
That's so scaring.

42
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,560
Sorry, I...

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,909
We'll get warm faster

44
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,220
if hugging each other.

45
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,780
Are you still upset about

46
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,900
your look?

47
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,890
Much less than before.

48
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,340
Sis Yan said my eyes make me an actress.

49
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,850
I also like your eyes.

50
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,070
I also told Sandy about it.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,190
Actually I noticed
you a very long time ago.

52
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,580
Although your acting skills
are not mature,

53
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,480
your eyes are firm and sharp.

54
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,860
It'd be a pity if you get ignored.

55
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,800
So Sandy actually

56
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,700
kept watching you for me.

57
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,530
Then those things happened.

58
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,700
Well, what I am now,

59
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,620
is it the same as you imagined?

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,480
You think I would be wrong?

61
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,530
You're much better than I imagined.

62
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,500
You're more like a cat than I imagined!

63
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,130
Shut up! Or I'll scratch your face!

64
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,969
Although it's kinda like

65
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,490
lines in some vulgar romance drama,

66
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,140
we do have been through
many things together.

67
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,779
Yes, we have.

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Let's make a bet

69
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
on the two roles.

70
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,260
You just want to be famous?

71
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,410
Or you want to be an excellent actress?

72
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,820
Think it over.

73
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,310
You performed much better than I thought.

74
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,370
This is your reward.

75
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,600
So, everything has been arranged by you.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,700
No, it's our kismet predetermined by God.

77
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,110
Our lines are getting more vulgar.

78
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,309
Yes, vulgar.

79
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,290
Do you want something more vulgar?

80
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:13,880
Okay.

81
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,540
Well, just now...

82
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,450
Well, it's...

83
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,210
Yes, it's...

84
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,530
Acting practice.

85
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,690
Morning.

86
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,460
You slept well?

87
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:11,810
Yes.

88
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,460
Xiao Jian!

89
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,860
Su Xiao!

90
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,930
It's so good to see you being safe.

91
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,730
I was so worried.

92
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,610
Don't worry, I'm not that weak.

93
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,310
Director Gao.

94
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,580
Why are you here?

95
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,410
He rushed here the minute
the storm stopped.

96
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,140
He even left his film behind,
to be finished editing.

97
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,459
Director Gao.

98
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Su Xiao.

99
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,090
Thank you!

100
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,660
Isn't it a matter of course?

101
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,510
You're the most important friend to me!

102
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,670
It's good that everyone is all right.

103
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,730
Sorry, we made you worried.

104
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,880
How is the shooting equipment?

105
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,310
Most of the equipment are broken.

106
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,600
You two were off the camera
ever since the storm.

107
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,090
What a pity.

108
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,949
You two's relationship
didn't get to the X-rated?

109
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,780
What do you mean by that?

110
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,090
My offence. Forget about it.

111
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,660
Jianjian.

112
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:17,959
Let's go.

113
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,120
It's not good to your skin
basking under the sun.

114
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

115
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's go.

116
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,060
Um.

117
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,550
What should I do?

118
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,740
I don't know

119
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,890
how to get along with him
naturally in the future.

120
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,440
Xiaoxiao!

121
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,970
Come up or I won't take you with us!

122
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,830
Wait, Sandy!

123
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,449
Xiaoxiao.

124
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,620
You suffered a lot.

125
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,040
Sandy said that
it's so dangerous this time.

126
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,580
It's kinda a rare experience.

127
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,769
I'm gonna reward you with this big feast!

128
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,020
Su Xiao, you're so awesome.

129
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,690
I'm gonna keep this episode for good.

130
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,829
The diving suit is
quite suitable for you, Xiaoxiao.

131
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,260
Indeed. It's because she's in good shape.

132
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,500
Cut. Cut. Cut.

133
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,350
What's wrong?

134
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,920
Anything wrong about my acting?

135
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,960
Your emotion is not right.

136
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,310
It's far away from
the asked scenario requirements.

137
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,120
Liu Xuxu is not in a good mood today.

138
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,720
She's just like this.

139
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,600
Su Xiao!

140
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,280
Another new film
named you to be the heroine.

141
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,990
You got the role totally
by your real strength.

142
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,720
So great.

143
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,630
What's more, the film about cats

144
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,600
that Xiao Jian planned
has been passed officially.

145
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,030
You should also get prepared.

146
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,780
Sorry.

147
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,300
I misunderstood you before.

148
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,370
Thanks for your help
during this period of time.

149
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,490
Thank you.

150
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,000
Words are just words.

151
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,400
Not sincere enough.

152
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,920
Well, let's continue
our practice from now!

153
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,220
Look. Look.

154
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,550
We got so many new tails!

155
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,970
What do you say? Isn't it nice?

156
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,910
Do you like it?

157
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,400
