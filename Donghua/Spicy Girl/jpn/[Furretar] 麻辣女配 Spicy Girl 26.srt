Oh dear! My sweethearts are both here.

Sandy.

35
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,666
Li Xiwei, you're also here.

36
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,973
What a great feast.

37
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:47,933
Why didn't you call me here? I hate you.

38
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,390
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from Su Xiao?

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,093
Excuse us, Li Xiwei.

40
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:59,293
We're going to have
a very, very important meeting.

41
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:00,373
Bye.

42
00:02:02,053 --> 00:02:02,813
Wait a minute.

43
00:02:03,026 --> 00:02:03,720
Hurry, let's go.

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,093
See you next time.

45
00:02:15,306 --> 00:02:17,426
Mr. Li, do you want
more dishes as planned?

46
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:20,520
Keep going.

47
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:26,080
Why didn't you tell us that
he wants to sign with you?

48
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,466
I didn't want you to be worried.

49
00:02:29,186 --> 00:02:31,510
And I've refused him affirmatively.

50
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,920
Su Xiao.

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,266
Don't deal with such things alone next time.

52
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:36,960
You should let us know first.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,600
Get it?

54
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,360
Oh.

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,180
Do you know what kind of a man Li Xiwei is?

56
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,013
You think you can handle him?

57
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:45,649
How dare you contact him?

58
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,120
I didn't.

59
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,973
He managed to get my phone number.

60
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,520
I just went to refuse him.

61
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,730
You know what,
you shouldn't have been there.

62
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,853
You even ate in front of him.
Why bother deny it?

63
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:57,185
I didn't mean to dine with him!

64
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,053
But you ate everything up!

65
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,413
Good for you, you dare eat anyone's food.

66
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,306
Don't want to be
a domestic cat but a wild one?

67
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,493
I'm not a cat!

68
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,960
Stupid wild cat.

69
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:06,653
Freak.

70
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,426
Idiot.

71
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,240
Big freak!

72
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:09,185
Big idiot!

73
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
You two got to stop it right now!

74
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:17,345
Su Xiao.

75
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:20,360
Xiao Jian's angry
because he's worried about you.

76
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:22,546
You understand?

77
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,452
Okay, I get it.

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,466
I'll be careful next time.

79
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:29,626
As long as you can learn from this thing.

80
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:33,173
Jianjian, stop being mad.

81
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:38,333
Director Xu just contacted me.

82
00:03:38,706 --> 00:03:40,905
The editing of
Frost Cold As Blood has been done.

83
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,560
I gotta go there now.

84
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:44,959
You two make peace before I'm back.

85
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,540
Can you do that?

86
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:48,840
Oh.

87
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:02,440
Well, I'll be very careful next time.

88
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,140
Made you worried, I'm sorry.

89
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,100
Fine.

90
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,510
No.

91
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:12,050
Words only can't show your sincerity.

92
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:15,853
When did you buy all of this?

93
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:17,812
Which one to use?

94
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:18,653
This one.

95
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,186
This is not gonna stop, not gonna stop.

96
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,040
Freak will never be short of ways to play.

97
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,240
What's up, kitten?

98
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,920
Let's seize the time to practice.

99
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:31,280
Don't you always call me kitten!

100
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,213
And you said about the cat movie.

101
00:04:33,213 --> 00:04:34,560
When will it be filmed?

102
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,580
Why did you suddenly bring this up?

103
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,000
I wanted to say this earlier.

104
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:39,220
I always want to know.

105
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:41,546
You often make me
wear cat outfits for you.

106
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,866
You said it's for the film.
But I haven't seen the script till now.

107
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,519
Even if I'm stupid,
I'd see the problem, okay?

108
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:49,360
I'm an independent person.
I have my dignity.

109
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,786
I also need freedom!

110
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,020
Can you just respect me?

111
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,579
Look, you signed the contract all by yourself.

112
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,000
And you agreed to play a cat.

113
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:03,546
Yes, I agreed to it.

114
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,906
What a bore.

115
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:28,426
What's wrong with me?

116
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:31,533
Damn it, couldn't I just talk nicely?

117
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,293
Why?

118
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,960
I can't stop crying.

119
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:46,160
Su Xiao, morning.

120
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:50,973
I didn't sleep last night.

121
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:51,733
What happened?

122
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,933
Not what you expected.

123
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:57,053
What, so disappointing.

124
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:02,390
What happened then? Did you make peace?

125
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,053
It's so embarrassing.
I don't want to see him.

126
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:07,985
Alas, you can't even if you want to.

127
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,853
He didn't tell you that?

128
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:12,053
A program that he joins starts shooting today.

129
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:14,305
He's set out and will live in the shooting location.

130
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,653
Is that so?

131
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,466
He's not home.

132
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,253
I feel you two have
a much bigger problem this time.

133
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,706
Alas, what should I do?
Who can come help me?

134
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,506
Oh dear, it's Li Yan.

135
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,200
Hi, what's up? Anything wrong?

136
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:35,985
Now?

137
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:38,053
Yes, she's here. What's up?

138
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:39,973
Didn't you go to the shooting today?

139
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:42,280
Yes.

140
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:44,973
Really?

141
00:06:46,693 --> 00:06:48,960
Well, no problem on my side anyway.

142
00:06:49,346 --> 00:06:52,040
Well... Wait. You talk to her directly.

143
00:06:52,386 --> 00:06:54,693
=Li Yan=
Su Xiao, Li Yan has something to tell you.

144
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:56,012
Me?

145
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:59,546
Hi, sis Yan, this is Su Xiao.

146
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,560
Su Xiao...

147
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,840
Sis Yan, you... What happened?

148
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,053
I got a fever and now I can't get up.

149
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,505
Forty degree.

150
00:07:09,186 --> 00:07:10,973
Why did you suddenly get a fever?

151
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,973
I didn't go to the hospital,
so it worsened.

152
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:17,346
Sis Yan, you must go to the hospital.

153
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,160
But I have to work today.

154
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:21,610
