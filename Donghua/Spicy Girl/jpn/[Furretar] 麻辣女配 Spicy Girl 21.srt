34

No one now cares about me
dancing with Li Xiwei.

35
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,749
Did he do this on purpose? To help me.

36
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,540
What if the media made up a story?

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
How to solve that then!

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,370
If I signed with Li Xiwei,

39
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,850

Director Gao's drama is gonna be released.

48
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,270
I'm looking forward to
the outcome of our bet.

49
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,890
A bet?

50
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,670
On what?

51
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,690
Which role that you play is more popular

52
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,900
after the two works get released?

53
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,030
If the role that you choose wins,

54
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,120
no matter what kind of role
you want to play,

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,040
I'll help you get it.

56
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,089
It's all up to you.

57
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,679
However,

58
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,140

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,270
in the future,

60
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,510

that I choose for you.

Have you been eating regularly?

66
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,429
I'm waiting for you to see the drama

67
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,050
in which you first starred as the heroine.

68
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,540

Come on! We're all here to accompany you.

76
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,330
That's right. Xiaoxiao.

77
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,500
It's the premiere day of
your first heroine drama!

78
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,660
Since when did you two hit it off so well?

79
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,270
I'm so shame-making!

80
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,510
Alright. It's coming soon.

81
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,910
Kind of excited.

82
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,420
Xiaowei! Xiaowei.

83
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,160

84
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,470
Xiaowei. Really you.

Sorry, I'm not leaving you alone again.

86
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,749
If you dare do
such a dangerous thing again,

87
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,440
I'll never forgive you.

I can feel the inner world of this role.

91
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,930
Really? Thank you.

92
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,570
You know, Su Xiao starred it.

93
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,250
I just thought
she would definitely kill the man!

94
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,730
Nice role. But not Su Xiao's style.

95
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,509
I still prefer the style
she showed before.

96
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,240
Am I right? Speaking of Su Xiao,

97
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,360
everyone's going to
think it's a vicious...

98
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,949
What's wrong? Did I say anything wrong?

99
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,820
Never mind. You don't need to comfort me.

100
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,209
After all, it's the first time
I starred this kind role.

101
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,780
It's hard to change the impression.

104
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,730
Nice role. But not Su Xiao's style.

105
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,660
I still prefer the style
she showed before.

106
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,910
Well then, I'm lost?

107
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,090
No! I can't get disheartened!

108
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,740
No matter what setback I'm facing,

109
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,220
I cannot be upset.

110

114
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,120
I'm fine. What's up?

115
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,940
It's not easy to try a brand new style.

116

Well. Xiao Jian contacted me.

120
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,280
He said he has finished
the shooting at Hollywood.

121
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,060
Then he'll come back to do the rest.

122
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,020
He'll be home tomorrow night.

123

124
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,760
I'll come to see you two tomorrow.

125
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,060

Xiao Jian is coming back.
We haven't seen for days.

130

Although we've had video calls,

131
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,710
about the bet, don't know what he will...

132
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,930
Long time no see, Su Xiao,
how have you been doing?

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,430
Forget about the bet.

134
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,180
Just smile.
'Cause I like seeing your smile the most.

135
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,980
No! No! No! How could he be like this.

136
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,910
Maybe he would just be like this...

137
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,120
Long time no see! My cat!

138
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,740
Come on! Come on! Smile.

139
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,110
