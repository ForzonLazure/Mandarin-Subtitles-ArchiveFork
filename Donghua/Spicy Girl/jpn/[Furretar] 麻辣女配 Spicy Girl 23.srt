=Episode 23=

31
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,590
You're still stubborn.

32
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,840
Oh, I saw the online drama you starred.

33
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,970
Thank you, sis Yan. Thanks.

34
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,830
Li Yan, let's talk about other things.

35
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,020
The role doesn't seem right for you.

36
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,930
Excuse me, your dishes.

37
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,120
Thank you.

38
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,460
Don't get it wrong.
I'm not saying you didn't play it well.

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,180
Oppositely, as an actress
who has never challenged such a role,

40
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,350
you've done a great job.

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,880
Even so, the roles you've played have left

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,370
great impression on audience.

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,650
They would be naturally
influenced by that impression.

44
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,050
I've met the same problem.

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,540
Su Xiao, you've a
characteristic appearance.

46
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,880
That's more impressive.

47
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,630
However, that's not a bad thing for you.

48
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,840
Although your appearance doesn't quite

49
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,209
match the current style
of the leading roles,

50
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,130
I like it very much.

51
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,209
Especially your eyes.

52
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,369
But my eyes look fierce.

53
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,350
They always say I can only play villains.

54
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,020
You got determined eyes.

55
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,820
It's easy to touch people.

56
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,340
As an actress, it's an admirable talent.

57
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,810
So, you don't need to worry about this.

58
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,459
What you've to do then
is to try different roles.

59
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,420
To accumulate experience bit by bit.

60
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,570
Experience?

61
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,450
Even you got all the villain roles.

62
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,650
But each work wants
different things from the role.

63
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,260
Do keep it in mind.

64
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,610
The work does not exist to
improve the image of the actor.

65
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,630
While the meaning of an actor is
to improve the quality of the work.

66
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,580
Alright, that's all
I wanna say about work.

67
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,090
Let's enjoy the food now.

68
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,020
Li Yan cares about you.

69
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,150
I think she specially
came to enlighten you.

70
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,310
What's up?

71
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,900
I'm eating now.

72
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,050
No matter how much people praise her...

73
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,080
It tastes so good!

74
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,160
It still can't compare with
her idol's few words.

75
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,200
Yes, tastes good.

76
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,090
Here you are. We brought some for you.

77
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,550
Food in this restaurant is really nice.

78
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,100
Li Yan recommended it to us.

79
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,230
I'm going on location as of tomorrow.

80
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,940
No need to prepare meals for me.

81
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,890
Yes. Xiaoxiao is alone
at home then. Right?

82
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,060
Then I think you can get off me.

83
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,870
Well... Fingers crossed.

84
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,530
I got things to do.

85
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,029
Why you two are acting
like middle school students?

86
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:20,659

Xiaoxiao!

90
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,900
Director Gao called me.

91
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,079
Ah?

92
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,949
He said he wanted you to

93
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,290
play a role in his drama.

94
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,819
Thank you for coming in person.

95
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,190
Director Gao, you're welcome.

96
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,550
It's me who should say thanks.

97
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,410
Xiao Jian is not with you?

98
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,600
He has spare time,
but I don't want him to come.

99
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,420
What about your bet?

100
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,260
It's been settled.

101
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,400
He said I can make decisions on my own.

102
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,710
That's great.
It means he has totally trusted you.

103
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,020
Er... A little, maybe.

104
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,620
You did very well in my film last time.

105
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,210
But I think I haven't made
your acting fully shown.

106
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,810
So...

107
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,640
I've thought it over and over again.

108
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,680
I can't just let it go at that.

109
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,870
So, I'd like to cooperate with you again!

110
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,400
Maybe it sounds kinda emotional,

111
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,759
but I've already taken you as my partner.

112
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,060
This time,
the role I want you to play is...

113
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,170
It's a villain. Quite vicious villain.

114
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,730
It's okay. Don't hurry to reply me.

115
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,610
Okay.

116
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,350
I'd like to do it. A villain.

117
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,779
=Su Xiao Calling=

118
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,580
Hello.

119
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,390
Are you available now?

120
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,270
I'm just taking a break,
but not much time.

121
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,579
I agreed with
Director Gao to play the role.

122
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,820
The budget is not high,
so not a long shooting period.

123
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,610
I see.

124
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,530
The most vicious villain by far.

125
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,540
I will definitely do it well.

126
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,600
Okay. Since you're playing it,
do it the best.

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
It may last long as I see.

131
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,160
I really wanna go home early
and rest in my bed.
