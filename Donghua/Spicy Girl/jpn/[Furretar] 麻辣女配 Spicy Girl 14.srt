00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,749
So tired. I got pain all over.

32
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,500
Xiaoxiao, may I come in?

33
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,629
Come on in!

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,090
You had a long day today.

35
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,010
It's alright.

36
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,430
You got torture scenes tomorrow, you okay?

37
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,890
Don't worry.

38
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,799
Although you won't get trauma
with a layer of artificial skin,

39
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,022
it still hurts to be whipped.

40
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,043
Never mind.
I can bear this since it's all for our movie.

41
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,740
It's okay. Sis Sandy, don't worry about me.

42
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,990
Xiaoxiao.

Can Su Xiao bear this?

45
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,250
Shall we let the stand-in do this?

46
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,333
It's close shot this time.
She asked to do it herself so as not to bloop.

47
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,044
Try to finish it at the first try.
All divisions, get ready.

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:26,970
Okay.

49
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,149
Su Xiao, I'll try to control my strength.

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,610
Never mind. Just make the scene perfect.

51
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,360
Otherwise, there's no point in my doing so.

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,990
Okay.

53
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,119
Alright. Ready to start.

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,370
Guys! Camera on! Get ready.

55
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,660
It's okay. I can do it.

56
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,420
Ready. Action!

57
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,920
How dare you betray me!

58
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:08,969
It hurts so much.

59
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,355
I brought you up. That's how you repay me?

60
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,910
Father, I know I'm wrong.

61
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,410
Good. One last line.

62
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,790
Next time, I do take her...

63
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,300
Cut! Who is that!

64
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,170
I'm sorry, it's kinda chilly. I...

65
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,511
Don't you know it's synchronously recording?
Get out of here!

66
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,680
I'm terribly sorry.

67
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,390
Liu Xuxu!

68
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,770
I gotta scratch your plastic face!

69
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,529
Sandy! Calm down! Calm down!

70
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,511
Shut up! You guys with no duty, just get out!

71
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,030
Let me go! Let me go!

72
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,490
Su Xiao, can you hold on?

73
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,500
If you can't, the stand-in can do this.

74
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,790
I'm okay, director. One more time.

75
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,129
Su Xiao.

76
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,130
I wanna make it perfect, please.

77
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,088
Okay, one more! Make it the best!

78
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,889
Got it!

79
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,519
Cut! Perfect!

80
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,020
Are you alright, Su Xiao?

81
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,066
I'm fine, how is it, director?

82
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,690
Better than the last one.

83
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,690
Well done.

84
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,360
Oh, my poor girl.

85
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,240
Just praise me, okay?

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,410
Do you remember what I said last night?

87
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,711
Never mind.
I can bear this since it's all for our movie.

88
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,670
Xiaoxiao.

89
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,920
But listen to me, don't push yourself so hard.

90
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,488
Rest assured. I think

91
00:05:09,555 --> 00:05:11,480
I finally got the chance I've been waiting.

92
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,720
I wanna exert all my efforts.

93
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,810
It doesn't matter even if I get hurts.

94
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,270
Otherwise, I will regret it in the future.

95
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,730
Good girl.

96
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,740
Well done, Xiaoxiao.

97
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,280
Thank you, Sis Sandy.

98
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,490
It's done.

99
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,870
You've to go back for something, right?

100
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,660
You're hurt now, I'd better be with you.

101
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,870
Never mind, I'm fine.

102
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,920
Well, I'll go and come back tomorrow night.

103
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,050
Bring me some delicious food.

104
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,840
Okay.

105
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:50,920
Coming.

106
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,720
How is Su Xiao?

107
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,970
We come to see her.

108
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,260
Is Ms. Su alright?

109
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,600
She's fine, don't worry.

111
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,022
Okay, that's all for today's shooting. Thank you.

112

Well done. Go back early and have a good rest.

113

Okay, thanks, director.

114
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,870
Why is this place so spooky at night?

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,170
I should have gone with them.

116
