Did you get hurt?

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,000
I’m really sorry.

33
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,210
The hem seemed to be caught in something.

34
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,420
Can someone get the first-aid kit here?

35
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,800
Su Xiao! How could you be so careless!

36
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,889
What if you hurt Sis Yan!

37
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,430
I’m alright.

38
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,180
Sis Li Yan.

39
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,519
Fortunately, Sis Yan doesn’t get hurt.

40
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,600
Su Xiao, how come you fell over on flat ground?

41
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,940
Did you do it on purpose?

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,520
What do you mean by that?

43
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,900
It’s obvious.

44
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,189
There is nothing on the ground
can get you tripped.

45
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,279
Never mind.

46
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,755
There’re props all over the site,
totally a mess. Just be careful.

47
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:07,666
Sorry, I was careless. Sorry to trouble you.
Really sorry.

48
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:10,600
Was it so?

49
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,830
You didn’t mean to hurt Sis Yan

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,580
and take her place as the heroine, did you?

51
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:17,040
=Action=

52
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,010
I really don’t know why I fell over.

53
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,970
You... Why so fierce?

54
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,680
Since some people suspect I did it on purpose.

55
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,760
Why don’t we go check the surveillance videos?

56
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,510
Let’s see what the hell happened.

57
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,059
What... Surveillance videos?

58
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,230
Yep. There is nothing on the ground
that can get me tripped.

59
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,730
Why are you so arrogant!

60
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,320
I can tell what you really are by your face!

61
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,610
Why bother to check that?

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,320
Eh, then someone might step on my hem.

63
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,950
Maybe it has shoe prints on it.

64
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,622
Could it really...

65
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,977
Enough, stop it.

66
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:50,288
Don’t delay the shooting.

67
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,670
Yes. Sis Yan is right. Shooting comes first.

68
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,790
Su Xiao. You need to bandage up the wound.

69
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,380
Okay.

70
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,470
It’s really her!

71
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,560
Thanks for your hard work. Thanks.

72
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,559
I won’t let you off!

73
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,860
Darn it! How could there be such a mean person!

74
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,279
She got me hurt and put the blame on me.

75
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,910
Liu Xuxu was also the candidate
for the supporting role.

76
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,080
She might be ill-affected since you got the role.

77
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,290
Why didn’t you check the surveillance videos?

78
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,290
If she did it,

79
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,410
I could get her removed from the crew.

80
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,660
You don’t have to.

81
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,330
I can take care of it by myself.

82
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,790
I’m not that timid.

83
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,210
What a silly girl.

84
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,260
But I like it. Let me hug you.

85
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,550
When is your next shoot schedule?

86
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,340
Tomorrow,
I need to finish what we haven’t done today.

87
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,969
Speaking of this, lend me some movies.

88
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,850
I wanna learn from them.

89
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,020
What do you want to do?

90
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,899
Put me down! What’re you doing?

91
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,570
Don’t move.

92
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,990
Go to bed early tonight.

93
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,070
Okay.

94
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,670
Su Xiao, why you’re acting like a letting agent?

95
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,860
Be serious, okay?

96
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,230
This is a movie,

97
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,550
not that kind online drama you starred.

98
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,880
This is a good role.

99
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,889
Fingers crossed.

100
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,220
I’ve to find a way.

101
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,480
How long are you going to sleep?

102
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,269
Time for breakfast.

103
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,819
I’m starving now.

104
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,610
Freak! I’m hurt, how to cook for you.

105
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,370
You can cook by yourself if you don’t like.

106
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,844
Help. I can’t focus on the movie
in such awkward atmosphere.

107
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,690
Maybe I should go back to my room.

108
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,111
Wait. Isn’t he going to hold me up, is he?

109
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,110
What’s wrong?

110
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,844
Well... Don’t you have to go to work today?

111
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,133
Lost your job? They found you’re a freak?

112
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,329
I’m doing my work now, as a producer.

113
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,790
You’re working now?

114
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,670
Yep. I’m reading the gossip news.

115
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,080
That’s not work, okay?

116
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,040
Learning what's going on
in the showbiz is part of my job.

117
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,420
Take Liu Xuxu for example.

118
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,260
Do you know she has given the
whole face cosmetic surgery?

119
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,130
Really?

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,639
I can tell her nose is fake.

121
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,720
Look, before the surgery.

122
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,060
And this, after the surgery.

123
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,400
Jaw plastic, forehead enhancement,
double-eyelid surgery, open canthus.

124
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,190
That’s right. Also risorius implant.

125
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,610
The whole chain is fake.

126
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,940
You can pinch it next time, maybe it’ll deform.

127
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,450
Are her breasts fake?

128
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,177
You know what, many actresses have fake breasts.

129
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,750
I’m not one of them.

130
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,630
You rascal!

131
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,170
What’re you doing! You freak!

132
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,880
