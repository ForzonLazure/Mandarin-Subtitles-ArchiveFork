Hey, you! Did you bully Su Xiao?

35
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,240
No! No! Not like that.

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,470
Not like that, I'm just too nervous

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,279
and restless because I couldn't find you.

38
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,060
Really? Nothing happened?

39
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,210
I wonder if I have the honor to
invite you to sign with our company?

I'm relived then.

41

Can I think it carefully?

45
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,250
Surely, you can. If you're interested,

Hey! As my assistant,
how dare you not answer my calls!

49
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,150
Fine. You didn't answer my calls?

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,029
I gotta add it into the contract

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,500

You're done with the film, right?

56
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,040

What's so strange about that?

71
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,320

72
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,830
Well... You can't dance well.

73
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,620

75
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,820

76
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,270
Really?

77
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,450

78
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,580
Go ahead then.

79
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,320
Mr. Xiao, may I invite you
to dance with me?

80
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,180
Sure. Please.

81
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,510
Ready, go! One, two, three, four.

82
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,230
Not so good.

83
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,310
What?

84
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,830
Back straight.

85
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,350
It's pretty straight, okay!

86
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,180
Straighter than a mongoose!

87
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,610

88
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,269
Be careful. Don't step on my feet.

89
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,400
So annoying.

90
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,840
Keep up with the pace.

91
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,370
But... How to say.

92
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,990
I feel so relaxed.

93
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,920
Well... Danced well.

94
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,560
I... I've to get up early tomorrow.

95
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,590
Oh, yes.

96
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,280
Good night.

97
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,250
Good night.

98

Never thought we really
came to a terrific place.

99

100
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,170
I'm hating you now.

101
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,780
Cut! Wonderful!

102
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,470
You mean she danced with Li Xiwei?

103
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,010
Su Xiao told me that.

104
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,590
I'm worried the media will hype it up.

105
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,690
That will do her bad.

106
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,399
Do you want me to do something?

107
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,620
No need. If we take the released news off,

108
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,540
that will draw people's attention.

109
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,350
As long as another
bigger news is released,

110
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,829
no one will pay attention to her news.

111
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,290
Hey, Xiao.

112
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,030
Ready for the next scene.

113
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:38,759

115
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,569

your phone a lot lately.

116

You're in a relationship?

117
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,780
Not that.

118
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,370

119
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,130
she would be your wife in the future.

120
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,000
