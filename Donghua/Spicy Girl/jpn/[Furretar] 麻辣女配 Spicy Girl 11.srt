Xiao Jian! This liar! Freak!

32
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,111
He even said he wouldn't have interest in me!
I'm pissed off!

33
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,180
Damn it! So embarrassing! Oh, no!

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,260
We'll meet tomorrow! Oh, no! What to do?

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,470
Oh, my! He is coming upstairs!

36
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,480
He is here!

37
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,860
You bastard! Liar! Freak! Don't come over here!

38
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,244
I know I'm in good shape, yet you can't molest me!

39
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,933
Those lines marked in red, what's wrong?

40
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,250
I couldn't finish that scene well.

41
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,589
Take me as Liu Xuxu, and hit on me.

42
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,170
No, I refuse!

43
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,010
Aren't you a professional actress?

44
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,260
Okay, as you wish.

45
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,100
This lady, you're fair...

46
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,770
That's like a yob trying to chat up.

47
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,520
I told you I couldn't get the feeling!

48
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,700
What... are you doing?

49
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,740
This lady, you're fair

50
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,540
and pretty.

51
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,960
What a pity to be a courtesan here.

52
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,750
Would you like to go on a carefree journey with me?

53
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,380
I wouldn't mind even if your boobs were fake.

54
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,130
I've told you...

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,100
Keep going.

56
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,440
What nice scenery here.

57
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,150
Yes.
Glinting lake and the petals falling like snow.

58
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,643
Childe, you're quite of elegance.
The scenery is at its best at this time.

59
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,369
But I'm not here for the scenery.

60
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,370
So you're also a worldling aimed at bounty.

61
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,976
You got me wrong. I meant I'm here for beauty.

62
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,010
This lady, you're fair

63
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,355
and pretty. What a pity to be a courtesan here.

64
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,360
Would you like to go on a carefree journey with me?

65
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,240
I'm flattered.

66
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,030
I want nothing more but you this life.

67
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,740
Cut! Ok.

68
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,960
Su Xiao. Well done.

69
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,932
Liu Xuxu, what's wrong with you?
Relax. You showed too much just now.

70
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,260
Er... I'm sorry.

71
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,590
Give Xuxu several close-ups from another angle.
Edit it.

72
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,759
Okay, director.

73
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,377
What happened? She showed completely different.

74
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,440
OMG! Su Xiao is so charming today!

75
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,555
Impressive acting!
I also wanna be chatted up by her!

76
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,150
Fast progress.

77
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,570
You... What the hell made you...

78
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,740
This lady, you're fair.

79
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,660
Throw in the sponge?

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,200
No way!

81
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,420
Liu Xuxu. The costume will be torn.

82
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,839
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,670
Er... Your chin...

84
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,470
She did have plastic surgery.

85
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:15,021
Yes.

86
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,800
That's all for today's shooting!
Thank you all. See you tomorrow.

87
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:24,650
=Filming Set=
See you tomorrow.

88
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,480
Well done.

89
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,900
Sis Li Yan.

90
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,779
The scene you reshot today was incredible.

91
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,449
Really? Thank you, sis Li Yan.

92
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,822
Guys! Have a break!
Mr. Li brought some desserts to visit us.

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
So nice!

94
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,750
You must have had a long day.

95
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,300
Would you like something to eat?

96
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,670
I'd like to eat. But I'm losing weight.

97
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,970
It's quite not easy being an actress.

98
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,930
Well, I feel jolly empty.

99
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,140
Take one then.

100
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,810
Many thanks.

101
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,020
Sis Li, time to go.

102
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,440
Okay, I gotta go.

103
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,520
Don't worry, Mr. Li. Every one of us will work hard.

104
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,530
Okay. It's so exciting.

105
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,690
See you tomorrow then.

106
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,780
Su Xiao, see you.

107
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,110
Okay. Sis Li Yan, see you tomorrow.

108
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,830
Director Xu thinks quite highly of you.

109
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,080
Really? Thank you.

110
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,355
But thanks to you, Liu Xuxu has got a miserable day.

111
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:26,170
How was the shoot today?

112
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,790
It sucked, okay!

113
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,977
Everyone was around Su Xiao. I'm freaked out!

114
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,720
What's wrong? What made you so mad?

115
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,720
Have a cake and chill out, okay?

116
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,470
Look at me! Do you think I'm in the mood to eat?

117
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,060
All Su Xiao's fault!

118
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,190
She went to the hospital.

119
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,310
Sandy is not here today?

120
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,622
Sis Sandy hasn't arrived yet. I go remove my make-up.
And then call him.

121
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,511
If he got tied up, I can send you back.

122
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,800
We're going in the same direction,
I can give you a lift.

123
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,080
You're making up to Xiaoxiao?

124
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,080
Sis Sandy?

125
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,130
I... I didn't do anything.

126
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,750
Just kidding, Li Xiwei.

127
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,630
Sorry, Xiaoxiao. I'm late.

128
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,844
Well, Xiaoxiao is after your heart?

129
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,180
About work, you can come to me.

130
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,088
Er... Okay. If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

131
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,180
See ya.

132
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,020
