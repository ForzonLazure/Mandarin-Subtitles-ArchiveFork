00:01:28,386 --> 00:01:29,853
Thinking about shootings lately,

32
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,980
I think I'm quite in a good state.

33
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,389
Su Xiao.

34
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,060
I think you're at your best
during our cooperation this time.

35
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:39,480
Thank you, director.

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,866
Though we've just cooperated twice.

37
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,730
I will perform better in the future.

38
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,879
It's so great that
you've played this role.

39
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,180
But what's embarrassing is,

40
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:53,050
maybe some audience will hate you again.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,332
After all, it's a hateful role.

42
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:58,226
Then it proves that I acted well.

43
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,010
Actually you're very cute in the reality.

44
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,050
The audience have been cheated by you.

45
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:04,579
Yeah.

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,250
It's actually not bad
to play a female villain.

47
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:12,540
It seems that I enjoy playing even more.

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,290
You just want to be famous?

49
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:18,093
Or you want to be an excellent actress?

50
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,700
Think it over.

51
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:30,253
=Unidentified Number=

52
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,529
Who's this?

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,030
Hi.

54
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,529
Sorry to call you so suddenly.

55
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,933
This is Li Xiwei.

56
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,660
Mr. Li?

57
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,253
I got your phone number from someone else.

58
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,030
Anything that needs my help?

59
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,660
Can I dine out with you on this weekend?

60
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,580
I'm really sorry.

61
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,820
You'll be working that day?

62
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,520
Reporters of the tabloids

63
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,466
will cook up news based on a few photos.

64
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,505
So even your family
will be involved into trouble.

65
00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:04,300
We're unfamiliar and
there's no reason for a treat.

66
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:07,520
Well, I borrowed you a handkerchief
on the reception, right?

67
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,520
Could you give it back to me?

68
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,640
Take this.

69
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,893
I'll mail it to you after washing it.

70
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:17,066
That handkerchief is very valuable.

71
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,999
I wish that you could
give it to me face-to-face.

72
00:03:19,386 --> 00:03:20,660
See you on the weekend.

73
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,680
Welcome to Scorpio Club.

74
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,533
May I ask, are you Ms. Su Xiao?

75
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,172
Yes.

76
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,580
Let me keep your coat.

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,870
Thanks.

78
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,080
Excuse me, Su Xiao.

79
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,880
I made you come here dining with me.

80
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,580
It's good that you know it.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,580
This restaurant is
limited to membership guests.

82
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:57,720
Paparazzi won't come to take photos.

83
00:03:58,626 --> 00:03:59,790
Just be relaxed.

84
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,130
I see.

85
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,920
So you're pretty thoughtful.

86
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:06,973
I have some connections in the media.

87
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:09,292
I heard that you bumped into
some troubles before.

88
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
But don't worry, I've given them a lesson.

89
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,760
They won't be impertinent again.

90
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:17,040
Okay. Thanks for such a
valuable handkerchief.

91
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,493
It must be very expensive.

92
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,170
The price doesn't matter.

93
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,586
The reason why it's valuable

94
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,305
is that it carries a memory of you and me.

95
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:26,560
So scaring.

96
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,053
Don't be afraid. Don't.

97
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,453
I'm just kidding.

98
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:31,425
A mind reader?

99
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:32,780
That's more scaring then.

100
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,786
If my attitude was too tough,

101
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,830
allow me to apologize to you officially.

102
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,949
Please don't be mad at me, okay?

103
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,920
No, I'm not mad.

104
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,500
My face just doesn't look friendly.

105
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,706
If there's nothing else, I'd better...

106
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

107
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,380
This is a nutritious set meal
for women to keep fit.

108
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:51,373
Please try it.

109
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,280
I invited you over here

110
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:57,266
to talk about the exclusive contract.

111
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,880
But I already refused it before.

112
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,080
But I said that
I would keep trying, didn't I?

113
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,500
To be honest,

114
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,380
I've prepared three good scripts
with you playing the heroines.

115
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,819
And the hottest themes.

116
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:14,640
=Xiao Jian Calling=

117
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,280
Damn it.

118
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,533
I'd better hang it up first.

119
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,600
Just pick it up.

120
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:32,920
Hi.

121
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,500
Where have you gone?

122
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,892
Didn't I tell you to inform Sandy first
if there's anything urgent?

123
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,720
I'm dining with someone.

124
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,692
You just got photographed
by the paparazzi!

125
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,000
You've forgotten it so soon?

126
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,889
I won't be photographed here!

127
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,040
I'll be back soon.

128
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:46,630
Where are you?

129
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,670
I'll tell Sandy to drive you back.

130
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,266
No need, I'll be back very soon.

131
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,760
Welcome to Scorpio Club.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,733
He heard it...

133
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,733
Hey, you really don't need to come here...

134
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:58,266
He hangs it up...

135
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:01,413
What do you say?

136
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,800
If you sign with me, I think your career

137
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:06,733
will arrive at a higher level very soon.

138
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,253
Maybe.

139
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,040
Su Xiao.

140
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,533
I'm really very sincere.
I want to make you popular.

141
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,290
Oh...

142
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:16,773
What's up?

143
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,932
You seem absent-minded.

144
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:21,293
Sorry. Sorry.

145
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,013
Is it because of the call just now?

146
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,252
Your boyfriend?

147
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,480
No. No. I don't have a boyfriend.

148
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,830
Well, I'd better go back first.

149
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:31,186
Let's go Dutch.

150
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:32,106
I see.

151
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:33,213
Got it.

152
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:36,000
Mr. Xiao Jian, please wait a minute.

153
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:41,613
I'm really sorry.

154
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,385
This gentleman insisted...

155
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:44,572
Never mind.

156
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:45,880
Back to your work.

157
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,380
Hi, isn't this Xiao Jian?

158
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:51,079
What brought you here?

159
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,453
Long time no see, Li Xiwei.

160
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,640
My assistant hadn't come
back home so late at night.

161
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,773
I was afraid that she
might run into some bad guy.

162
00:06:56,773 --> 00:06:57,573
So I came pick her up.

163
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:01,493
If you mean Su Xiao, just rest easy.

164
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,066
I'm here. No bad guy
dare get close to her.

165
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,385
That's hard to say.

166
00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:07,080
Some guy looks like a gentleman.

167
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,080
But he's thinking about
some hideous plan deep down.

168
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,733
It's safe only when I'm with her.

169
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:13,760
I think I've seen this scene just now!

170
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:15,466
So, do you mind joining us?

171
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:15,960
No, thanks.

172
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:18,040
Why didn't you tell me about this first?

173
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,759
Sorry.

174
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,319
I made Su Xiao come here to see me.

175
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,653
I hope that you won't do this again.

176
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:27,386
Now, let's go back.

177
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,800
Sorry.

178
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,250
But you don't have the right to
interfere with her personal life, right?

179
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,692
Because she's mine.

180
00:07:35,386 --> 00:07:36,573
His? I'm his?

181
00:07:37,693 --> 00:07:39,680
But she told me that
she doesn't have a boyfriend.

182
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:43,066
I mean, she's signed with me.
So I should take care of her.

183
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,130
You should have said it clear!

184
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:46,213
I see.

185
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:48,000
You said that she's your assistant.

186
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:49,880
So I thought she hasn't signed
any broker company.

187
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,040
Actually, she's going to negotiate
for a very important project.

188
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,346
So can we leave now?

189
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,640
It seems that
it's because I'm ill-informed.

190
00:07:57,906 --> 00:08:00,759
Why I heard that she just has to
play some petty villains lately?

191
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,173
We're considering for artists
in a long run.

192
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,240
Unlike some company, they just pursue
short-term popularity by dirty means

193
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:09,290
and dump the artists
after drying out their value.

194
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,066
Is that so?

195
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,940
But does your company know it's traffic
that matters the most in this era.

196
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,065
If no views,
even if you're the movie king,

197
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,013
you'll be forgotten by the audience.

198
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,613
What should I do? What should I do?
What should I do!
