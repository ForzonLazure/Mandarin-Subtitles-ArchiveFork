=Episode 03=

31
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,556
I have no choice

32
00:01:31,236 --> 00:01:33,079
but to turn to Xiao Jian.

33
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:33,702
I don't know

34
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:36,081
how it'll be like in the future.

35
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:37,992
But,

36
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:39,340
he also said that

37
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,680
he needs me to play a cat to study performance.

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,267
Maybe

39
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:43,720
he was telling the truth.

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,350
After all, he's Xiao Jian,

41
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,817
a national-level super star,

42
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,539
a super movie king,

43
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:48,440
and the nation's idol.

44
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,850
How could he lie to me?

45
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,561
Just to wear a cat outfit,

46
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:52,940
what's to be ashamed of?

47
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:55,677
Well,

48
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:57,440
it's so shameful anyway.

49
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:58,906
Alright.

50
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:00,650
Let's call it a day now.

51
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,820
So shameful.

52
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,320
It's so shameful!

53
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,820
You freak!

54
00:02:04,912 --> 00:02:06,734
I think you're just making fun of me!

55
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,829
But it's also a part of the contract.

56
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,540
But the new broker for you is coming soon.

57
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:12,999
My advice, you need to get changed.

58
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,880
It seems that he's already here.

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,880
He... he is?

60
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,130
Now it's okay.

61
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:19,960
You...

62
00:02:20,238 --> 00:02:20,754
So fast.

63
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,590
Hi, who's there?

64
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,300
Hi, hefty man.

65
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,140
Hi, you're here.

66
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,190
Hello, Jianjian.

67
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,801
Morning.

68
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:36,185
Hello, baby.

69
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,610
Hell... Hello.

70
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,768
Sorry

71
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,746
to make you come here in person.

72
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:42,360
No problem. No problem.

73
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,149
I've been idling for years.

74
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,120
It's time to check on the
very important one I'm responsible for, baby.

75
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,712
You're Su Xiao, right?

76
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,910
Just call me Sis Sandy.

77
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,620
From now on,

78
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,290
I'll be your broker.

79
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,130
Sis Sandy is a very excellent broker.

80
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,170
From now on, your work...

81
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,420
You seldom gave me praise.

82
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,510
What's wrong today?

83
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,130
Jianjian, you miss me?

84
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,550
Go away.

85
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,640
What a monster.

86
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,550
Fine.

87
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,391
Well,

88
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,060
what kind of actress Su Xiao wants to be?

89
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,930
Well...

90
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:12,809
Just like

91
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:14,350
Li Yan.

92
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,810
She doesn't look like a bad girl.

93
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,737
She's pure

94
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:17,404
and beautiful.

95
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:18,650
And she can play the heroine.

96
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:19,346
Li Yan.

97
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,569
You mean Li Yan?

98
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,525
Stop kidding me.

99
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,516
That's impossible. Impossible.

100
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,820
Why impossible?

101
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,490
Having a dream matters a lot.

102
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,499
How can you mock at others' dream like this?

103
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,249
Jianjian, why do you still hold such a bad habit?

104
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,670
I see.

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,007
You think that the heroine is at
a higher level than the female villain.

106
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:43,300
Right?

107
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,523
Never mind.

108
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:46,970
Just keep working hard like this

109
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,300
and take Li Yan as your goal.

110
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,640
I've seen two shows of you.

111
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,866
Your performance is meticulous
and right in place.

112
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,331
You're very talented.

113
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,152
Thank you.

114
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:55,942
Well...

115
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,293
Sis Sandy.

116
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,440
As of today,

117
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:01,980
I'll spare no effort to support you, honey.

118
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,110
How should I tell it to my brother?

119
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,330
I'm back, brother.

120
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,870
So tired mentally.

121
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,080
Why are you home so late today?

122
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,910
And you look so tired.

123
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:20,999
Many things happened.

124
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:22,009
Have you eaten anything?

125
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:23,840
I've made some soup.

126
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,090
Go to sleep after you drink it.

127
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,800
What's wrong?

128
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,180
It's all because of Xiao Jian, that freak.

129
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,100
Now I have to leave my dearest brother.

130
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:34,980
What?

131
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,240
Brother.

132
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:37,811
I'm really sorry.

133
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,758
From tomorrow on,

134
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:42,560
I have to live in the company's apartment.

135
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,230
Apartment?

136
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:45,133
Can you take care of it?

137
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,104
Su Da.

138
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:51,199
Can you give a worried facial expression?

139
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,085
Mr. Song.

140
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:52,870
You're also here?

141
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,030
I'm not worried enough?

142
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,079
Fine.

143
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,403
If there's anything,

144
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:58,620
remember to call me right away.

145
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,459
Sorry.

146
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
I can't cook for you at home any more.

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,026
Don't worry about me.

148
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:05,800
Take good care of yourself.

149
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,300
Thank you, brother.

150
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,980
I've made the choice.

151
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,610
I got to make it till the end
no matter how hard it is.

152
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,819
Never mind.

153
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,940
Sandy said that he'll help me.

154
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,150
And that freak...

155
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:31,339
He probably

156
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:33,200
can be reliable sometimes.

157
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,990
What's going on?

158
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,310
Okay.

159
00:05:40,544 --> 00:05:41,916
She'll try this one next time.

160
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:48,836
Wait...

161
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:53,180
It's too fast. I can't catch it!

162
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,889
Alright.

163
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,470
Let's play another one.

164
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,970
Come. Come.

165
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,640
This way. This way.

166
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,430
Come catch this.

167
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:58,931
Come.

168
00:05:58,986 --> 00:05:59,434
Hurry. Hurry.

169
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:00,180
Come on.

170
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,560
What on earth am I doing?

171
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,980
It's been days since I signed the contract.

172
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,190
I did nothing serious

173
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,860
but house chores here.

174
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,819
Now I'm just like a baby-sitter.

175
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,205
I quit. I quit!

176
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:15,780
He may find someone else.

177
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,410
Why should I have to clean up the room,
cook and wash clothes for him every day?

178
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,040
Go find someone else!

179
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,304
=Xiao Jian the Movie King looks after a baby!
What a warm and touching scene!=

180
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,756
Our Jian is so caring!

181
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,190
Ah, I'm so intrigued!

182
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:28,125
I want to have a child with Jian!

183
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:29,952
I also want a hug from him!

184
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,982
Xiao Jian please marry me!

185
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:32,920
When will Jian be a father?

186
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:34,819
What's that comment?

187
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:35,982
Who will marry you?

188
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:36,828
=I'll see it ten times!=
Xiao Jian is my child's father!

189
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:37,723
=I want to become that baby...=
Our Jian...

190
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:39,986
During private time...

191
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:42,504
Basically,

192
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:43,702
I just read books

193
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,904
surf on the Internet,

194
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,965
and watch some old movies at home.

195
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,826
I really don't have any special hobby.

196
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,012
I think,

197
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,569
roles are just roles.

198
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,739
My private life

199
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:57,159
is actually very boring.

200
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,370
What the hell?!

201
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,290
Xiao Jian is such a double-dealer!

202
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,700
He's actually a big freak!

203
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,870
Who's a freak?

204
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,670
It hurts. It hurts.

205
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,836
If you want to show cuteness,

206
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,840
put on the cat outfit first.

207
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,710
It hurts so much, my gosh.

208
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,287
And,

209
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:12,672
did you cook?

210
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,800
What did you say?!

211
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,930
You really take me as a baby-sitter?

212
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,019
I warn you,

213
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:21,560
Movie King Xiao,

214
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,350
I've gotten many secrets of you.

215
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,350
Your fame will be doomed
if I just put several of them online!

216
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,150
You better not piss me off!

217
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,980
Look how awesome you are.

218
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,480
Do you need me to kiss you, hug you and hold you up?

219
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,320
Shut up!

220
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,590
If you get it,

221
00:07:34,674 --> 00:07:36,400
you should respect me more!

222
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,700
Go post it then.

223
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,570
But,

224
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,725
the audience will believe me,
a national-level movie king,

225
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
or you, who specialize in playing villains?

226
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,259
If I say that you hype maliciously
using my popularity,

227
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,930
my fans will diss you to death by then.

228
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,640
=Totally Defeated=

229
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,760
=Totally Defeated=
Then your image will be ruined totally.
