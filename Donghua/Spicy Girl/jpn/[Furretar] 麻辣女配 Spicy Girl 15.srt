Stay calm. In this case,

32
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:35,590
I should...

33
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:36,040
Don't move!

34
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,670
It's me.

35
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,680
Why you?

36
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,010
I scared you?

37
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,590
I was scared to death!

38
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,970
Mad?

39
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,850
How dare you laugh!

40
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,390
If you were a second later,
I would have crushed your foot!

41
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,310
And kicked you off, okay!

42
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,610
What brought you here?

43
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,159
What? Of course it's because I felt lonely.

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,530
I felt so lonely since I couldn't
touch “my cat” every day!

45
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,700
Hands off me! Don't you touch my hair!

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,656
I heard that you did the flogging scene in person?

47
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,272
Yes. The director also praised me
that I did so well.

48
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,250
Are you made of iron?

49
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,010
With a layer of artificial skin,
you dared to get whipped?

50
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,010
You have a thick skin?

51
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,640
Do you think the props are made for fun?

52
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,010
What if you get hurt?

53
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,560
What if the shooting is delayed? That matters.

54
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,890
Just hurts a little. Won't get trauma.

55
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,560
It would be too late if you get trauma.

56
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,150
So you're here to scold me?

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,980
Not that.

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,740
I come to play with “my cat”!

59
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,040
Thanks for sending me back.

60
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,160
Save it till you back home.

61
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,960
Get lost!

62
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,290
You idiot! Freak! Idiotic freak!

63
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,170
Hello, Sandy.

64
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,800
The news is done.

65
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,760
It'll be released tomorrow morning.

66
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,510
Well done.

67
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,220
I'm going back to the hotel.

68
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,600
Did you contact Su Xiao?

69
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:17,850
Yes.

70
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,279
Was she happy to hear your voice?

71
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,820
Maybe.

72
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,710
What's this?

73
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,000
=Su Xiao did flogging scene in person=

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,170
What's going on?

75
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,420
Was there a reporter on the scene?

76
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,040
=Comments: Sis, don't get hurt!=
=She is so professional!=

77
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,459
I didn't find that!

78
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,760
They're praising me! OMG!

79
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,590
Tell that freak now.

80
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,100
I have to impress him this time!

81
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,100
=Xiao Jian=

82
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,520
Video call?

83
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,730
He saw the news?

84
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,649
Why that fast?

85
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,610
Could it be...

86
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,690
I saw the news.

87
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
You did so well.

88
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,950
Gosh! What to do? Help me!

89
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,160
Who can help me? I'll feel shy and blush!

90
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,450
No way! I can't let him find that.

91
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,580
=Su Xiao=

92
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,880
She is not up yet?

93
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,470
What kept me waiting so long?

94
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,896
You know,
a fairy like me needs time to come down to earth.

95
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,810
Come down to earth? With face down?

96
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,190
What's up?

97
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,819
I'm going to Egypt today.

98
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,150
It's boring to fly for ten hours.

99
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,320
Does it have to do with me?

100
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,410
Why called me so early in the morning!

101
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,370
I also have something to tell you.

102
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,416
Well. In this case, I'll be generous and forgive you.

103
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,590
Do listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.

104
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,589
And keep it in mind.

105
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,460
In fact...

106
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:09,256
I love you so much!

107
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:10,552
Stay with me, okay?

108
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,850
You... You... What're you doing?

109
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,184
No, no, no! Not me! It's Liu Xuxu next door.
Liu Xuxu! Not me!

110
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,360
Sorry, I gotta hang up.

111
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,449
Wait! Wait for a second!

112
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,410
What?

113
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,240
Record it now! Hurry!

114
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,199
Why record this? I gotta hang up.

115
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,400
Listen. This hotel was booked for the whole crew,
no outsider can live in.

116
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,696
Don't you wanna know who Liu Xuxu is talking to?

117
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,920
How is it going?

118
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,180
That's indeed Liu Xuxu.

119
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,760
Who is that man?

120
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,220
I heard Liu Xuxu called him Mr. Lin in the middle.

121
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,430
So? Who is that?

122
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,650
There is only one who surnamed Lin in the crew,
don't you know?

123
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,230
I see.

124
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,940
Lin Hao is one of the investors of this movie.

125
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,030
This gossip really diverts me.

126
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,370
Hope you won't tease me to divert yourself.

127
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,120
Let me get you a new cat outfit to
show my apology, okay?

128
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,660
Is that an apology?

129
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,680
Idiot. Anyway, it's really an interesting gossip.

130
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,880
I forgot to tell him the news that I got praised.
