Su Xiao, smile. Smile.

32
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,120
No. I'm too nervous to smile.

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,120
We're here to get you more job offers.

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,180
The offer won't come to you
if you're like this.

35
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,900
I've never seen you before, newcomer?

36
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,130
I'm in a good mood today.

37
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,510
Come drink a little with me.

38
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,930
I'll take care of you in the future.

39
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,100
You're drunk, I think.

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,779
Leave this to me.

41
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,440
Hey, what are you doing?

42
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,120
Do you know my identity?

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,480
Darn it. I do need more chances.

44
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:12,219
But not this kind of chance.

45
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,250
Su Xiao? Why is she here?

46
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,850
No more preferential treatments?

47
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,890
That means no more good roles, doesn't it?

48
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,360
It seems Mr. Li has taken
a fancy to another actress.

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,480
I prefer this quiet place.

50
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,480
What?

51
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,580
Liu Xuxu?

52
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,560
Thanks to you!

53
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,550
My career is totally ruined!

54
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,880
I don't know what happened.

55
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,679
But you gotta know
it's you who ruined your career!

56
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,690
Why put the blame on me?

57
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,030
Bullshitting!

58
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,350
How many dirty things you've done

59
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,350
to snatch roles and resources?

60
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,560
You must be clear about that!

61
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,230
You want me to tell you one by one?

62
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,760
You really think you can get away with

63
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,690
the bad things you've done?

64
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,600
I haven't lost yet.

65
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,840
You've already lost since the day

66
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,190
you got something by trickery.

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,450
I don't play dirty tricks like you do.

68
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,780
If you really wanna get even with me,

69
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,670
you can uprightly
compete with me next time.

70
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,640
Just wait and see!

71
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,550
I'll wait for you, Liu Xuxu.

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,420
I'm really sorry.

73
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,860
I'm also responsible for
what Liu Xuxu has done.

74
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,880
Mr. Li, that's kind of you.

75
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,309
She only has herself to blame.

76
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,190
Moreover, it's common in the showbiz.

77
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,259
Ah, sorry. I was being so self-righteous.

78
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,310
Really sorry that I influenced your party.

79
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,540
What a funny girl you are.

80
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,250
Er... Where is Sandy?

81
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,380
I like this song very much.

82
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,230
Ah? I see.

83
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,710
Such a rare chance.

84
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,050
May I have a dance with you?

85
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,300
Right here?

86
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,130
Yes, may I?

87
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,670
What's... going on? Why...

88
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,710
What's the situation now?

89
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,100
Alright. Let's get started.

90
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,990
Forget it. Just dance.

91
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,279
You're a good dancer.

92
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,980
I'm flattered.

93
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,800
I'm telling the truth.

94
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,480
How lucky I am to have
such an elegant dancing partner.

95
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,570
Elegant? Me?

96
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,560
Rather elegant.

97
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,970
Moreover, you're of intellectual beauty.

98
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,700
Intellectual beauty!
I've never heard such a praise!

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,069
Su Xiao. In my eyes,
your acting skill is like yourself...

100
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,920
Are you alright?

101
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,090
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,180
Never mind.

103
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,569
Don't know why I suddenly...

104
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,230
Maybe someone is speaking ill of me.

105
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,150
What's going on?
Why didn't answer my call?

106
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,150
I specially chose her spare time at night.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,800
Have some hot water.

108
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,610
Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Li.

109
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,250
Be careful, don't catch a cold.

110
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,420
I'll give it back to you
after I clean your hanky.

111
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,970
Su Xiao, could you please

112
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,470
give me your own phone number
if it's possible?

113
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,160
I wanna talk with you
about something in private.

114
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,500
Gosh! What's going on? Macho boss?

115
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,090
What a cool move! Oh, no!
Feeling of heartbeats!

116
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,800
I'm sorry. You can just
go talk to my broker.

117
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,670
But I just wanna talk to you.

118
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,310
Sandy! Where are you!

119
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,050
I know that. I know.

120
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,780
I'll tell Su Xiao. And call you back.

121
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,970
Oh, Su Xiao.

122
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,250
I saw the clips of
Frost Cold As Blood in advance.

123
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,000
You did quite a good job. Very impressive.

124
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,850
Thank you for your compliment.

125
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,400
It's not so easy to play that role well.

126
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,240
It's set as a cold-blooded villain.

127
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,630
Your performance
have vivified the character.

128
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,270
When the film is released,

129
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,270
your popularity will definitely increase.

130
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,040
And you'll get a steady
flow of film offers.

131
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,760
Hope so.

132
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,030
I have faith in you.

133
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,280
I'm praised!

134
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,930
Easy! Steady myself! Don't get dizzy!

135
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,210
What's wrong? Did I say something wrong?

136
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,770
Not that.

137
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,420
If you can tell me your phone number,

138
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,040
I wanna talk with you in private.

139
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,590
To see if you'd like to cooperate with us.

140
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,420
Maybe it sounds not
so modest for me to say this,

141
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,300
but our company is
one of the best in the industry.

142
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,090
Sure thing.

143
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,310
So, Ms. Su Xiao.
I wonder if I have the honor

144
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,230
to invite you to sign with our company?

145
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,180
Sign with you? You wanna have me join you?

146
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,740
Yes. That's why I specially
invited you here today.
