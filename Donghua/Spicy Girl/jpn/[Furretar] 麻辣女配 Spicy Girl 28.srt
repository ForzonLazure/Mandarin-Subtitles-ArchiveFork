37
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,710

Well, I have to go now.

46
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,170
Well, I'd like to stay here for a while.

47
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,490
What you just said to me,

48
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,739
I got it.

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,490
Ready?

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,790

Now you're satisfied?

53
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,770
Next, it's swimsuit show.

54
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,590
In the order of
current scores of every team,

55
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,720
the boy shall choose
a swimsuit for the girl first,

56
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,060
and then the girl
puts it on to give a catwalk.

57
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,110
The final scores will be
decided by the mass judges.

58
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,980
Gentlemen,

59
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,619
please go pick out
the nicest for your partner!

60
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,210
Alright.

61
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,580
Time for the last team, the Blue team
with the least scores, go for it!

62
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,570
It's totally a mess here.

63
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,970
Damn it, these are all so ugly!

64
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,160
Alright, next it's the
exciting catwalk show.

65
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:10,373
So beautiful!

66
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:13,333
Looks so nice!

67
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,253
So beautiful!

68
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,990
The last one.

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,580
Let's welcome Su Xiao!

70
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,730
What the hell is this?

71
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,010
And you finished the task so fast.

72
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
There won't be a shot of
you during the final editing.

73
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,590
Didn't we agree on more shots?

74
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,840
Since that...

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,750
Good, she knows to show her face.

76
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:32,733
So beautiful!

77
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,430
I see. What a good plan.

78
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,860
Su Xiao is in such good shape.

79
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,110
But the swimsuits prepared are too gaudy.

80
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,670
That'll make her
be judged as vulgar and tasteless.

81
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,466
-But...
-The diving suit not only looks healthy,

82
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,260
but also shows Su Xiao's good shape.

83
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,760
The shock brought by mask off

84
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,690
also shows her cuteness.

85
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,300
What...

86
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,110
The pose you made is so interesting!

87
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,269
Sis, you're so beautiful!

88
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,880
The swimsuit Xiao Jian
chose for you fits you well.

89
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,980
You're best partners.

90
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,600
Thanks. Thank you, everyone.

91
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,690
Next, it's the second half
of today's game.

92
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,090
25-meter freestyle swimming.

93
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,830
Beauties in swimsuit,
time to show your skills!

94
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,450
What's wrong?

95
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,400
I can't swim, actually.

96
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,020
Ah? You...

97
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,460
I thought you could even do triathlon.

98
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,270
I nearly drowned when I was a child, so...

99
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,240
I see. I'll go ask for a waiver.

100
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,310
Don't.

101
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,860
I don't want the show to be boring.

102
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,080
So I'm proved to
have chosen a right swimsuit.

103
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,889
According to the information we just got,

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,710
the player Su Xiao can't swim.

105
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,959
But she doesn't want to give up the game.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,430
She asks for a swim ring instead.

107
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,069
Everyone, please cheer her up.

108
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,720
Su Xiao, go for it!

109
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,960
Don't give up!

110
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,050
So shameful.

111
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,430
Everyone, take your marks!

112
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,040
Ready?

113
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,180
Does she do this to me on purpose?

114
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,880
Why I'm still here? Come on!

115
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,180
I won't give up!

116
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,630
This is so hard.

117
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:47,960
What should I do?

118
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,140
I haven't moved an inch.

119
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,440
-Come on! -Don't give up!

120
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,060
Believe yourself, you can do it!

121
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,020
You performed well.

122
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,700
Go for it, Su Xiao!

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,589
