A bet?

32
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:30,960
On what?

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,790
Which role that you play is more popular

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,130
after the two works get released?

35
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,090
If the role that you choose wins,

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,260
no matter what kind of role you want to play,

37
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,970
I'll help you get it.

38
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,140
It's all up to you.

39
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,200
However,

40
00:01:46,552 --> 00:01:48,720
if the role that I choose wins,

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,608
in the future,

42
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:53,600
you can only play the role that I choose for you.

43
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,328
Okay.

44
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:57,200
Let's make this bet.

45
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,776
You're the Movie King.

46
00:01:58,848 --> 00:02:00,770
You can't go back on your word if you lose.

47
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,370
It seems that it's getting more and more fun.

48
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,410
Su Xiao has such high morale?

49
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,500
So my work will definitely work out.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,936
For this bet,

51
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:13,250
Su Xiao will surely win!

52
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,670
When we start shooting,

53
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,420
you two,

54
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,670
firstly, get close to each other slowly.

55
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,520
At this distance,

56
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,528
bang!

57
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:22,090
Switch to No.2 camera at once.

58
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:22,904
And then,

59
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:25,800
you look into each other's eyes soulfully.

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,568
And then, slowly and slowly,

61
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:28,510
the camera

62
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,312
gets closer and closer.

63
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:31,016
And suddenly,

64
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:33,010
stop!

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,696
Okay, it's ready.

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,060
It's okay.

67
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,860
I can play it well.

68
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Now feel the scene.

69
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,490
I'm gonna be separated from my love.

70
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,779
Feel it.

71
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,450
Okay, let's shoot it.

72
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,119
Okay, camera on.

73
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,016
Ready?

74
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,209
Action!

75
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,960
I'm really sorry.

76
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,170
Why...

77
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,130
Stop crying.

78
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,380
I can't lose you.

79
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,130
Cut! Cut! Cut!

80
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:08,911
Su Xiao.

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,060
Come check out the playback.

82
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,810
Okay.

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,350
Su Xiao.

84
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,440
In this scene, he breaks up with her

85
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,730
in order to keep her safe.

86
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,480
It's a sad scene.

87
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,110
Understood.

88
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,860
I'm really sorry.

89
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,399
Why...

90
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,360
Stop crying.

91
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,110
I can't lose you.

92

I can make it tomorrow.

96
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,130
Where's Su Xiao?

97
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,130
Still not back?

98
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,040
After a day's shooting,

99
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:51,850
only a few shots can be used.

100
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,672
Now,

101
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:55,930
she's being sad in her room.

102
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,100
I knew it.

103
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,309
Jianjian.

104
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,610
How could you know that?

105
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,270
Isn't it obvious?

106
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,320
Jianjian, you're so bad.

107
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,190
Go comfort her.

108
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,110
No need.

109
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,279
I can make it tomorrow.

110
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,870
So confident.

111
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,660
Of course.

112
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,740
I was just too nervous today.

113
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,480
My acting skills are very good.

114
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,816
I used to make it just by one shooting.

115
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,648
Yes.

116
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:18,295
You're right.

117
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,960
I do steal your man.

118
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,710
It's because you're so useless.

119
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,460
I lied to you.

120
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,459
So what?

121
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,590
Isn't it because you're too stupid?

122
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,050
As long as this old man dies,

123
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,219
his wealth will be mine.

124
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,010
And then...

125
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:33,824
See?

126
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,470
Very well, right?

127
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,240
That's right

128
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,200
your problem.

129
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,900
Such performance

130
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,150
is like a robot with a set program.

131
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
It's not acting.

132
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,530
Just stress response.

133
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,600
What?

134
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,048
That's not stress response!

135
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:50,819
Listen carefully to Xiao Jian, Xiaoxiao.

136
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,370
You only played one kind of roles for a long time.

137
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,740
So the way of your performance has become rigid.

138
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,304
No matter what you play,

139
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:58,830
you only have those facial expressions.

140
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,460
Have you really considered the role's mentality?

141
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,504
What kind of person she is?

142
00:05:01,664 --> 00:05:03,000
What is she thinking about?

143
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,339
Why does she say something like that?

144
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,130
Have you ever considered such questions?

145
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,220
To challenge different roles,

146
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,350
it's far from enough by relying
on your previous experience.

147
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,310
Su Xiao.

148
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,390
You just want to be famous

149
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,480
or to be a really excellent actress.

150
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,810
Think it out.

151
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,440
You just want to be famous

152
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,569
or to be a really excellent actress.

153
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,160
Think it out.

154
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,829
=Shudian Film Park=

155
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,590
Hurry up.

156
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,009
You think you're a big star?

157
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,470
You're not afraid of affairs, but I am.

158
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,180
If there're photos about me staying with you,
who knows what kind of news will be released.

159
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,150
Thanks, everyone.

160
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,650
Xiao, why don't you play the hero this time?

161
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,819
I think the leading actor now
is more suitable for that role.

162
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,410
Choosing suitable actors,

163
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,410
is also my responsibility to take as a producer.

164
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,040
Thanks. Thanks.

165
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,710
This freak is so popular.

166
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,620
No wonder he's the movie king.

167
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,670
So many people get cheated by him.

168
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,670
Miss assistant.

169
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,880
Can you pass this gift on to Jian?

170
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,550
Assistant?

171
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,840
Thank you. Please.

172
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,339
But I... I...

173
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,220
And my gift, please give it to him.

174
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,890
Miss assistant.

175
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,770
He's an actor and I'm an actress.

176
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,650
But he's the popular movie king,

177
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,820
I'm taken as an assistant.

178
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,190
What a huge gap!

179
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,440
Little assistant.

180
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:57,240
We should go now.

181
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,450
Brother Wu.

182
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,580
Xiao Jian.

183
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
I should call you boss Xiao.

184
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,250
Don't say that.

185
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,170
I just come to make a visit.

186
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,670
You come here in person.

187
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,710
I'm really flattered.

188
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,380
I'll treat you after the shooting is done.

189
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,220
This is...

190
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,672
Hi, I'm Su Xiao.

191
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:19,080
I'm also an actress.

192
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,930
Really?

193
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,970
We can work together later if possible.

Okay.

00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,480
It seems that it's my turn now.

196
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,940
Let's continue shooting if everyone is ready.

197
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,190
I'm leaving then.

198
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,730
We can talk later.

199
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,690
Don't mind us.

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,450
Brother Wu has debuted for thirty years.

201
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,530
He's played supporting roles for thirty years.

202
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,024
But,

203
00:07:40,432 --> 00:07:42,783
he's a true actor.
