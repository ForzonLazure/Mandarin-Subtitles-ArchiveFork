Where are you rushing to?

32
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,010
You think you can escape from me?

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,350
Stop dreaming.

34
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,090
Cut.

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,260
Okay. Let's check it out.

36
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,670
Can you let go of me now?

37
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,410
Sorry.

38
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,249
I didn't mean to.

39
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,980
From where did they get such a horrible aunt?

40
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,820
Unbelievable.

41
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,790
Xin, you acted so well.

42
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,290
I even became worried.

43
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,740
Really?

44
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,820
You bet.

45
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,300
Come.

46
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,100
Clean it up.

47
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,070
Your hair is wet.

48
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,330
Don't get a cold.

49
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,960
Okay.

50
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,520
What does that little girl know?!

51
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,230
“Horrible aunt”?

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,530
That's called acting skill!

53
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,350
Playing villains also entails acting skills!

54
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,120
I've played 42 bad female supporting
roles since graduation!

55
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,540
Doesn't that show my experience and seniority?!

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,250
I don't want bad roles, either.

57
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,270
I also want to play the heroine!

58
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,220
You think I want to play the bad guy?

59
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,030
No more bad guys. No more.

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,330
I'm quitting even if I'll lose my job!

61
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,540
At worst I'll stop being an actress!

62
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,850
I'll find another job! I'll be a worker!

63
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,760
No more bad roles.

64
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,720
No.

65
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,600
I still want to be an actress.

66
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,320
I'm not gonna give up on it.

67
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,540
I'll be the heroine next time.

68
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,839
I won't quit!

=Director Gao=

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,959
Director Gao.

71
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,230
Hello, is that director Gao?

72
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,490
Yes.

73
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,330
Su.

74
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,899
Director Gao.

75
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,980
What can I do for you?

76
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,050
Here is the thing.

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
I'm considering

78
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,480
an audition for the heroine in my next work.

79
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,500
The heroine?

80
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,529
If you're interested,

81
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,750
come to my room right now.

82
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,500
Very interested!

83
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,160
On my way now!

84
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,190
I'll be there right now!

85
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,119
Damn it.

86
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,399
I wouldn't have drunk so much if I knew this.

87
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,530
I didn't expect that...

88
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,330
Director would call me at this moment.

89
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,400
But so late at night...

90
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,760
No, I want to throw up.

91
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,130
But it seems that...

92
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,779
All right, I better not think too much.

93
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,320
Finally, someone wants me to play

94
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,719
the heroine...

95
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:51,047
Yes.

96
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:52,660
Hurry come here.

97
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,010
Sorry.

98
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,840
I called you here so late at night.

99
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,600
It's okay.

100
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,290
I really

101
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,410
appreciate it that you could give me

102
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,190
such a good

103
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,170
opportunity.

104
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,059
What's wrong?

105
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,140
Why this kind of expression?

106
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:03,820
Nothing.

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,110
I'm just too happy.

108
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:13,164
=Sorry to make you watch this unpleasant scene=

109
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,740
Oops.

110
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,740
That vomit ruins my opportunity.

111
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,150
I'm really sorry.

112
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,860
You're fine now?

113
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,139
Yes, I'm fine.

114
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,780
But I stained your clothes.

115
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,880
Never mind.

116
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,580
As long as you can compensate me.

117
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,410
Compensate?

118
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,020
Yes.

119
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,649
Compensate!

120
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,170
What are you doing?

121
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,360
I know that.

122
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,579
You've been longing to get rid of bad roles, right?

123
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,090
But based on your conditions,

124
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,930
I think there's no director

125
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,319
willing to make you a heroine, right?

126
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,750
What?

127
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,060
What's wrong with my conditions?

128
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,080
As long as you obey me,

129
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,530
you'll enjoy endless wealth and honor,

130
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,730
and you'll always be the heroine.

131
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,520
Aren't these lines too old-fashioned?

132
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,680
How can you be a director by that?

133
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,260
Impudence!

134
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,370
You're just a third-rate actress.

135
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,990
How dare you talk back to a director?

136
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,280
Look into the mirror,
don't you know you have a face of villain?

137
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,440
It's lucky for you to be liked by me.

138
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,440
How dare you not accept it

139
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,420
but satirize me?!

140
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,050
If you don't listen to me,

141
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,520
you'll specialize in playing
spicy villains for a lifetime!

142
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,050
You'll never be the heroine!

143
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:14,870
Action

144
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,310
You gotta

145
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,040
shut up!

146
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,080
Taking advantage of me?

147
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,920
Are you kidding me?

148
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,870
I can accept it if you say my acting is bad.

149
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,520
But how should you say
I can never play the heroine?

150
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,650
Wait. Wait.

151
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,130
Wait.

152
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,100
Wait!

153
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,850
Look at these super stars.

154
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,630
Believe me.

155
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:39,220
Although I'm still a petty director now,

156
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:40,500
I'll be very capable in the future.

157
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,270
As long as I try best to make you popular...

158
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,710
You failed to take advantage of me.

159
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,600
So you started cursing me?

160
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,360
No.

161
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,500
I didn't mean that.

162
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,139
Having this face,

163
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,690
is it my fault?!

164
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,730
Ever since I went to elementary school,

165
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,160
due to this hellish look,

166
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,280
I got edged out of the games of my classmates.

167
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,810
When I was in high school,

168
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,650
I met a kid who got lost.

169
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,720
I meant to comfort him.

170
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,509
But his parents took me as a human trader.

171
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,170
After I became an actress,

172
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,200
I had my first role as a malicious female villain.

173
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
I played it so successfully.

174
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,009
So I become a villain specialist.

175
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,600
You want me to beat you?

176
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,010
I understand.

177
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,620
Once I was also a director caring about the world.

178
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,519
After graduation,

179
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,700
I've been dreaming of make a good work.

180
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,560
But no one invested in me.

181
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,819
I had no choice but to start from third-rate ads.

182
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,110
I worked harder and harder.

183
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,490
After having struggled for so many years,

184
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,080
It's my first time to do this actually.

185
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,566
Didn't expect that even a third-rate star
would ignore me.

186
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:46,820
=Third-rate Actress=
You could have saved the last sentence.

187
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,759
However,

188
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,250
I think I can understand you.

189
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,480
Although it's hard for us now,

190
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,100
if we continue working hard

191
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,940
for the sake of our dream,

192
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,730
one day,

193
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,560
we both will realize our dream.

194
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,170
Director Gao!

195
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,220
Su Xiao!

196
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:03,918
Director Gao!

197
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,610
Casting couch, director Gao?

198
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,800
Sorry to interrupt you.

199
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,740
Xiao Jian...

200
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,480
Xiao Jian.

201
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,880
The famous movie king.

202
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,080
Works starred by him got awarded
several times at various movie festivals.

203
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,530
Meanwhile he's also a board member of
a film and television tycoon in China.

204
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,320
He's invested many brilliant films
and television works.

205
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,350
He's a household name.

206
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,380
And he has a positive image.

207
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,960
Very popular.

208
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,019
He's called the No.1 caring boy

209
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,650
in the showbiz.

210
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,180
So, right now,

211
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:48,900
what's

212
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,570
going on here?

213
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,311
Boss Xiao.

214
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,820
The fact is not what you've seen.

215
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,488
It's a misunderstanding.

216
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,300
It's a sheer misunderstanding.

217
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,844
I hate it most that directors
misuse authority in the cast.

218
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,280
I bet you know that?

219
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,750
Su.

220
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,150
Hurry, please help me explain it.

221
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,444
We were just having a heart-to-heart talk, right?

222
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,111
But you talked about endless
wealth and honor and stuff.

223
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,980
How could a man like you

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,350
make out good works?

225
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,319
Don't you ever

226
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,690
ask me to invest in your movies!

227
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,040
No!

228
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,770
Help me take care of my mom

229
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,160
and my grandma's seventh brother!

230
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,569
Director Gao!

231
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,720
Didn't you just say to work hard for your dream?

232
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,311
Don't give it up so quickly!

233
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,660
Let me go!

234
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,840
Let me go to die!

235
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,620
Is it meaningful for me to live further?

236
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:31,920
Movie king.

237
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,289
Come give me a hand!

238
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,530
Let me go. Let me go to die.

239
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,610
Hurry! Or he'll be dead!

240
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:37,810
Whatever.

241
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,800
Let him jump and be dead.

242
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:42,192
=Action=

243
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,330
Are you still a human?

244
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,250
Aren't you the caring boy?

245
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,570
How could you look on at this moment?

246
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,240
Don't you have any humanity?

247
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,520
What national star.

248
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,719
I think you're just a cold-blooded animal.

249
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,660
Damn it.

250
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,600
I gave away my true color.

251
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,039
Now I've offended another man.

252
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,610
Fine.

253
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,060
I can remain my investment.

254
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,700
What's more,

255
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,450
I will not

256
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,310
spread this thing around.

257
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,439
What?

258
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,620
Why do you become so kind?

259
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,640
Of course, I don't ask for nothing.

260
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,930
There's a condition.

261
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,870
Condition?

262
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,429
I want you

263
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,100
