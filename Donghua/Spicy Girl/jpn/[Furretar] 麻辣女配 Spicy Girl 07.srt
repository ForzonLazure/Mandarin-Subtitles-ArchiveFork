31
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,829
Okay, Su Xiao.

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,540
This scene is about their
reunion after a long time.

33
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,380
Very warm and romantic.

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,590
Got it.

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,460
Let me show it to you.

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,050
Okay.

37
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,590
Wei.

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,260
Wei.

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,299
It's really you, Wei.

40
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,560
Sorry.

41
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,180
I won't leave you alone again.

42
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,930
If you do that kind of dangerous thing again,

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,100
I will not let you go.

44
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,070
Just like that.

45
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,175
Okay.

46
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:00,175
I see.

47
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,740
Let's start shooting.

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,950
Start.

49
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,450
Ready?

50
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:09,999
Action!

51
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,080
Wei.

52
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,790
Wei.

53
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,300
It's really you, Wei.

54
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:25,970
Sorry.

55
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,800
I won't leave you alone again.

56
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,533
If you

57
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,600
do that kind of dangerous thing again,

58
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,560
I will not let you go.

59
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,440
Cut!

60
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,110
Well done, Su Xiao.

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,030
You showed the feelings exactly what I want!

62
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,780
Awesome.She's into it.

63
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,422
Even I get moved.

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,120
The show is finished now.

65
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,240
Thank you, everyone.

66
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,444
Thank you for your work.

67
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:52,330
Thank you, everyone.

68
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,459
Su Xiao, thank you.

69
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,499
At first, I really didn't know how to do it.

70
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,340
Luckily, you played the heroine.

71
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,710
Director Gao, I'm flattered.

72
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,050
Don't worry.

73
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,800
About the bet you made with Xiao Jian,

74
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,066
you'll definitely win!

75
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,680
If the role that you choose wins,

76
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,430
no matter what kind of role you want to play,

77
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,429
I'll help you get it.

78
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,060
It's all up to you.

79
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,390
However, if the role that I choose wins,

80
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,511
in the future,

81
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:21,150
you can only play the roles that I choose for you.

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,700
Congrats, the movie is done.

83
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,700
Let's dine out to celebrate it.

84
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,377
My brother said that

85
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:34,870
he'll cook something delicious for me tonight.

86
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,250
Sis Sandy, join me?

87
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,330
How lucky I am.

88
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,130
Brother, I'm back.

89
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,630
Xiaoxiao, you're back.

90
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,630
Your guest?

91
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,050
Brother, this is my new broker, Sis Sandy.

92
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,970
Thank you for taking care of Xiaoxiao.

93
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,577
No... No problem.

94
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:50,100
It's my duty.

95
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,300
Thank you for taking care of Xiaoxiao.

96
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,640
He's Boss Song, from my brother's company.

97
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,000
He's also my brother's friend.

98
00:03:56,088 --> 00:03:57,730
He often eats with us.

99
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,310
Hi, Boss Song.

100
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,990
So many dishes!

101
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,030
All prepared to congratulate
on the closure of your movie.

102
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,860
Thank you, brother, you're so sweet.

103
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,700
Can we come to eat with you
every time the movie is done?

104
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,450
Feel free to come.

105
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,950
Why it's you to make the promise?

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,177
The more people come,

107
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,079
the more natural his visit will be.

108
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,120
Su Xiao...

109
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,420
That's the fact.

110
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,130
Don't say that.

111
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,210
What a good vibe.

112
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,380
I start eating, then.

113
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,050
Go ahead.

114
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,220
So delicious.

115
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,111
Xiaoxiao.

116
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,590
You become thinner again.

117
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,100
Didn't have breakfast well lately?

118
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,180
Because I was shooting day and night lately.

119
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,350
Day and night?

120
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,940
I... I told her to eat, really.

121
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,270
The next movie is coming soon.

122
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,030
I'm afraid that I can't eat well again.

123
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,400
Again?

124
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,860
She will eat well during the shooting.

125
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,030
I... I'll make it arranged.

126
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,449
Sandy.

127
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,950
What?

128
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,170
Do you want to try this?

129
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,577
Oh, yeah.

130
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:03,709
I'll eat it right now.

131
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,790
Don't be so intimidating.

132
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,250
You scared Sandy.

133
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,420
I just told him to eat more.

134
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,911
Well...

135
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:17,666
I should

136
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,660
leave now.

137
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,780
I'm killed again.

138
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,088
Here you are.

139
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:33,822
Look at this.

140
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,790
Nothing has changed.

141
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,600
Xiaoxiao...

142
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,290
Since she had cognition,

143
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,130
she's been upset about her look.

144
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,355
But,

145
00:05:49,377 --> 00:05:51,300
she's actually very cute.

146
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,509
I also think so.

147
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:53,680
But...

148
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,377
People

149
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:57,680
all like to judge from appearance.

150
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,180
Xiaoxiao really likes acting.

151
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:01,822
Of course.

152
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:04,940
She's very, very hard-working.

153
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,288
She makes progress every day.

154
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,480
We all can see that.

155
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,860
Don't need to be worried.

156
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,950
She'll certainly become
a very excellent actress.

157
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,990
Will she?

158
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,160
Don't tell Xiaoxiao that I'm worried about her.

159
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,133
Relax.

160
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:17,700
I won't.

161
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,790
Thank you then.

162
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,022
Brother.

163
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,500
Sis Sandy.

164
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,154
Look,

165
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:23,420
here's the dessert.

166
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,330
Looks yummy.

167
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,000
That's right.

168
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,750
I like making dessert ever since I was a kid.

169
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,170
Xiaoxiao, you worked hard.

170
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,550
And you washed dishes back here

171
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,509
and made the dessert.

172
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,640
I'm finally home.

173
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,010
I should do some house chores.

174
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,560
Thank you, Xiaoxiao.

175
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,560
Keep it up at work.

176
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,044
Xiaoxiao.

177
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,350
I also want a head-touch.

178
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:46,980
Go away.

179
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,150
Don't be shy.

180
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,230
Not shy, I'm unwilling to do it.

181
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,900
Go away.

182
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,780
Speaking of that...

183
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,740
Don't touch Xiaoxiao.

184
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,660
