Now I know he was lying!

Listen.

39
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:46,010
You talked about the contract every day.

40
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,123
But there's only me who's been
performing the contract.

You...

42
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,529
So close. So close.

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,720
Remember to call me Sis Sandy.

57
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,220
Sis Sandy.

58
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,220
What brought you here?

59
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,689
About the audition...

60
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,100
Did you get the script?

61
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,899
They've sent it to us.

62
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,730
You said that you need to check it.

63
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,725
So,

64
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:40,285
look,

65
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:41,834
I came here right away.

66
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,780
Come on in first.

67
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,226
Wait.

68
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,200
I was going to say that

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,266
I've been here for so long,

70
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,093
but where's the job that you promised?

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,570
Oh, right.

72
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,990
I've handled the job.

73
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,012
In a few days,

74
00:02:50,164 --> 00:02:51,580
you'll have an audition.

75
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,620
Jianjian, you didn't tell her that?

76
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,170
I tried hard to get it.

77
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,080
A role in director Xu's new movie.

78
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,920
Yes, the super famous

79
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,071
big director who often

80
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:02,209
shoots action movies.

81
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,260
Director Xu.

82
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,257
Director Xu!

83
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:05,382
Director Xu...

84
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,480
Congrats! You'll be

85
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:13,480
on the big screen!

86
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,573
Thank you.

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,808

91
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,029
So many dishes.

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,620
What's wrong?

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,248
Did you

94
00:03:35,337 --> 00:03:37,290
call food delivery instead?

95
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,420
You made so many dishes in such a short time.

96
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,790
And it tastes good.

97
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,089
Isn't it really not food delivery?

98
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,550
Will you die if you just praise me?!

99
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,300
Okay.

100
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,777
You better stop being an actress.

101
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:48,720
Go work as a cook.

102
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,640

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,890

108
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,059
Of course.

109
00:03:59,230 --> 00:03:59,728

112
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,328
I made a big effort to cook this.

113

looking for casting.

It's just an idol drama with little investment.

178

I need a kind and cute heroine.

179
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,444

Can't be more vulgar!

190
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,300
I don't agree with you to play this role.

191

Although the script is dull,

192
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:39,259

Kind and cute heroine.

194
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:41,890
It's my dream!

195
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,440
You both said my script is dull...

196
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,770
What do you know?

197
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,103
An actress chooses a role

198
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:47,190
based on if she can harness it,

199
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,310
not she likes it or not.

200
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,569
A super star like you
who can always get what you want

201
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,120
can never understand a neglected grass-root
like me who crave for a good role.

202
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,860
I didn't mean that.

203
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,860
Mr. Gao, keep away from them

204
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,530
in case we would be hurt as well.

205
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,296
Well, well.

206
00:06:58,344 --> 00:06:59,990
I knew you've been looking down upon me!

207
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,079
But I'll play the role well to prove you wrong!

208
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,540
Fine.

209
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,160
Since you're so brave,

210
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,620
take this role then.

211
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,360
But you must take the role

212
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,928
that I chose for you as well.

213
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,471
Let's make a bet

214
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:14,160
on these two roles.
