This is my first movie.

Gosh! Such a big-budget movie.

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,050
Easy. Easy. I'm not nervous.

Xiaoxiao, you're so cool!

37

Oh, no! What if I screwed it up?

38
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,440
Don't worry.

39
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,820
You've fully prepared.

40
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,650
Reciting your lines every day.

41
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,779
Practicing your fight actions

42
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,940
and those wire stunts.

43
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,240
You'll make it.

44
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,355
Ready!

45
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:12,088
Action!

46
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,860
Okay. Cut.

47
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,280
Well done. She's very promising.

48
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,030
Thank you. Please take care of her for my sake then.

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,330
Sis Sandy. Did I do it well?

50
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,290
Li Yan?

51
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,290
You did a good job.

52
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,749
Thank you for saying so.

53
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,630
Em... You two...

54
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,960
We've known each other for long.

55
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,959
Sandy has helped me a lot.

56
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,839
Oh, come on! Don't say that.

57
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,800
Ooh, he has never told me about that!

58
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,350
Haven't I?

59
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,929
This is a good role. Fingers crossed.

60
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,560
Okay, thank you.

61
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,059
Never thought I would shoot with Sis Li Yan!

62
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,060
It feels like a dream!

63
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,149
Ow! It hurts.

64
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,740
The hanging wire was too tight.

65
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,740
I got pains all over.

66
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,700
What to do with that?

67
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,790
I brought you my exclusive miracle unguent.

68
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,740
You can apply it later.

69
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,540
Really?

70
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,120
Jianjian also used it.

71
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,460
He said it does work.

72
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,580
Okay. Many thanks.

73
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,630
I clearly remembered I put the
medicine chest here.

74
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,220
Did anyone take it by mistake?

75
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,809
Su Xiao. Just wait and see.

76
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,270
I'm back!

77
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,850
Whew, so tired.

78
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,650
Ah! That freak went on location today.

79
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,900
That is to say...

80
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,650
I can fully enjoy myself here today!

81
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,110
I'm worn out having shot fight
scenes the whole day.

82
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,580
The luxury massage bathtub! I'm coming!

83
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,710
Ow! Ow! It hurts!

84
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,579
It hurts so much!

85
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,840
And now take out the freak's medicine chest.

86
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,420
Apply some of his unguent.

87
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,600
So comfy.

88
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,970
What a beat day today.

89
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,350
Keep going tomorrow.

90
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,780
This fool.

91
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,649
Just some fight scenes,
yet exhausted herself like this.

92
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,199
Looks better.

93
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,620
Good night.

=Frost Cold As Blood

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,219
Are you ready?

96
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,140
Director Xu. Yeah, ready.

97
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,970
We're too impatient to wait.

98
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,970
Okay. Let me explain this scene first.

99
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,650
Chu Yixiao who dressed as a boy is lurking here.

100
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,690
She sees a courtesan, and goes to molest her.

101
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,070
So as to get information from her.

102
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,990
Su Xiao. Your show time.

103
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,780
Okay.

104
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Is that okay with you?

105
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,450
Rest assured, director.

106
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,870
I'm not a newcomer doing my first movie.

107
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,500
Well then. Let's get started.
Hope it's done at the first try.

108
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,066
Ready!

109
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:48,200
Action!

110
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,890
This lady, you're quite fair and pretty.

111
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,760
What a pity to be a courtesan here.

112
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,720
Would you like to go on a carefree journey with me?

113
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,640
Cut! Cut! Cut!

114
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,600
Su Xiao, why you're acting like a letting agent?

115
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,769
You can't act like that.

116
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,110
Sorry! I'm sorry.

117
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,150
Be serious, okay?

118
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,570
This is a movie,
not that kind online drama you starred.

119
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,755
Stop it. One more time.

129
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,509
Director, really sorry.

130
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,800
I've never hit on a girl.

131
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,300
You've never hit on a girl,

132
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,180
haven't you ever been chatted up by a man?

133
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,180
Yes. No one dares to chat up me as I look termagant.

134
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,270
Forget it. Change the next scene.

135
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,690
Su Xiao, go get yourself fully prepared.

136
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,690
Feel your role thoroughly. Don't waste our time.

137
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,779
I'm terribly sorry, director!

138
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,240
You really can't bear the supporting
role for your first movie.

139
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,120
I still haven't thoroughly grasp the script.

140
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,170
Gotta borrow some classic movies from
movie king Xiao.

141
