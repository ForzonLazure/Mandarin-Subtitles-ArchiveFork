31
00:01:33,746 --> 00:01:34,600
How about this area?

32
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:37,520
You're gonna put up
the tents on the beach?

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,480
Yes, scenery is so beautiful here.

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
But is it safe?

35
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,612
For good shooting effects.

36
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:44,573
Yes. Yes. Yes.

37
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:47,340
It's so romantic to
sleep over the lapping of waves.

38
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:55,440
Su Xiao, you're pretty good at this.

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,260
When I was still a kid,
I often went camping

40
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,500
with my family in the mountains.

41
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:00,933
My dad taught me this.

42
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:03,786
He said that
I'm even more capable than my brother.

43
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,029
So you're quite a quick learner.

44
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:08,920
No wonder your acting skills are so good.

45
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,466
Ah? I'm flattered, Mr. Xiao.

46
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:15,905
Done.

47
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,506
I collected so many.

48
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:19,720
Isn't this enough?

49
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:22,946
This is a poisonous mushroom.

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,200
And this! And this!

51
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:26,892
Watch it clearly.

52
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:28,280
This is eatable.

53
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,720
This is poisonous.

54
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:31,600
They're totally different, okay?

55
00:02:33,746 --> 00:02:34,959
I can't see any difference...

56
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:41,986
Can't catch one with bare hand.

57
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:45,066
Is there anything in the tool kit
that can be used as a fishing net?

58
00:02:56,146 --> 00:02:57,706
Did I do anything wrong?

59
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:01,586
Step away.

60
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:18,306
Big harvest!

61
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,813
What a monster.

62
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,480
What good partners
Su Xiao and Xiao Jian have made!

63
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:25,306
They're in harmony so soon.

64
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:29,480
Su Xiao, don't let the cat out of the bag.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,880
There will be a grand feast!

66
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:48,080
Su Xiao, you seem to be good at cooking.

67
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:50,413
Anything that I can help with?

68
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:51,920
What are you talking about?

69
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,493
Aren't you always
sitting there waiting for food?

70
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:55,613
You silly cat.

71
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,973
Oops, you've seen that through.

72
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,106
I seldom cook actually.

73
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:03,853
But I got to mind the manners.

74
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:04,946
Sure.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,226
I could see it clearly
that you can't cook.

76
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:12,840
I almost had a heart attack.

77
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:17,013
Aren't you actually punishing me?

78
00:04:17,732 --> 00:04:19,600
They're performing so well.

79
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:22,413
It's Su Xiao's first time
in this kind of reality show?

80
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,160
She never joined
any entertainment show before.

81
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:27,786
So awesome.

82
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,880
Facing that super star Xiao Jian,
she doesn't feel nervous at all.

83
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,520
And it seems that
they're about the same level.

84
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,093
Yes... Yes.

85
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:37,226
I also feel surprised.

86
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:41,426
So delicious.

87
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:44,333
Really? I'm glad that you like it.

88
00:04:46,173 --> 00:04:47,773
I cooked much better than this.

89
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:49,240
But you never praised me.

90
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,053
What's wrong?

91
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:54,146
Nothing. This really tastes good.

92
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:57,626
I'm full.

93
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,110
Didn't expect that I could have

94
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,690
such a good dinner in a desert island.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,850
It's so lucky to be partners with you.

96
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:05,226
Not really.

97
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:08,746
He doesn't even blush
saying such ostensible words.

98
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,560
No wonder this freak
could have cheated the nation.

99
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,425
It's raining.

100
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:16,866
It is.

101
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,013
Su Xiao, let's put these items away.

102
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:19,506
Okay.

103
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,372
It's getting heavier.

104
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:28,146
Yes.

105
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:31,306
Su Xiao, we'd better
go back to the tent first.

106
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,270
In such a program, there will usually be

107
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,000
some man-made troubles
in the next morning.

108
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:37,746
Let's rest early tonight.

109
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:39,759
Okay.

110
00:06:09,773 --> 00:06:11,733
It's quite a selling point
to be a good cook.

111
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,199
I think Su Xiao
will definitely be popular.

112
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:16,840
We'll be waiting for
your program's invitation.

113
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,066
No problem.

114
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:20,493
Why it rains all of a sudden?

115
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:23,253
It's not said in the weather forecast.

116
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:26,066
Go check the latest weather report.

117
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,666
I feel worried now.

118
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,840
Director.

119
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:32,426
How is that?

120
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,120
Look.

121
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:35,880
What should we do?

122
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:37,933
What's up? What happened?

123
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,893
It's said that there
might be a storm at midnight.

124
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:43,186
Will they get hurt?

125
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:45,773
But it's just a possibility.

126
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:47,693
How about waiting for a while?

127
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:55,413
Director, I don't think this will do.

128
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,270
How about stopping the shooting

129
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,560
and picking them up back here?

130
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,746
But...

131
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,269
There's not but.
Stop the shooting right now.

132
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:04,146
The biggest concern of our program

133
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,280
should be the
guest players' personal security.

134
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,320
I know you might find it a pity, but...

135
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,053
It'll be too late
if they had any accident.

136
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,426
Indeed, it's too dangerous.

137
00:07:16,293 --> 00:07:17,453
Let's go pick them up now.

138
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:21,773
The waves are too heavy
that the ship can't sail out.

139
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,933
Su Xiao, Xiao Jian...

140
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,590
The wind is getting heavier.

141
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,770
It's not safe here.

142
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,480
