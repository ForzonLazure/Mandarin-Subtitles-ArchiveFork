Are you alright?

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,850
Hey! Wait! Wait!

33
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,250
You freak! Put me down! Freak! Freak!

34
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,090
You... You... What are you doing! Freak!

35
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,620
Hush. I can't bear loud voices now.

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,610
Was the work that hard?
You haven't even shaved.

37
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,580
My role needs this.

38
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,860
Oh, I see.

39
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:11,869
I've seen Director Gao's drama.

40
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,160
Your acting has improved a little bit.

41
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,929
You deserve this
since you've paid much effort.

42
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,360
But I still lost the bet.

43
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,940
So, you're accepting that
you can only play villains?

44
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,060
I didn't say that.

45
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,630
It's just I'm not capable enough.

46
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,589
I'm not so mature
about choosing a proper role.

47
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,620
Good. Then let's just
forget about the bet.

48
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,059
In the future,
you can choose the roles as you want.

49
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,170
Really?

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,130
You...

51
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,590
You did better than I thought,
this is the reward.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,330
How worse did you think of me?

53
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,850
Actually, I always...

54
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,230
Fall asleep! How can you
fall asleep at such a time!

55
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,660
Finish your words first, okay?

56
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,820
That's so excruciating!

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,490
Damn it! Wait and see.

58
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,400
Morning.

59
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,600
Morning. I'm making breakfast.
You can sit there...

60
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,420
What's wrong?

61
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,490
Er... Nothing.

62
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,790
Wait and see.

63
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,800
I forgot to wipe it!

64
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,950
I go clean my face first.

65
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,470
What's wrong?

66
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,070
Breakfast will be done in a minute.
Wait there.

67
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,430
You've to walk a long way to the bathroom.
That's tiring, right?

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,360
Are you crazy?

69
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,910
It's mark pens!

70
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,890
Vengeful freak!

71
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,710
How could you scribble on a girl's face!

72
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,910
Okay. Okay. We call it even.

73
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,759
You did it first, okay?

74
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,150
So funny!

75
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,550
You teased me as soon as you came back.

76
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,120
Okay, alright. Was everything alright
when I was not at home?

77
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,579
I wonder if I have the honor to invite you

78
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,440
to sign with our company.

79
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,319
=Mr. Li. Sorry, I've to turn down
your offer of the exclusive contract=

80
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,910
Yes. All going well.

81
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,319
Then I think you can get off me.

82
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,580
I'm a man, you know.

83
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,420
You freak!

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,569
Good morning. Jianjian, are you back?

85
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,330
You're back.

86
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,110
Crap.

87
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,020
Why are you eating alone?

88
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,110
What's wrong with your face?

89
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,090
I slapped him. He asked for it himself.

90
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,420
I smell the gossip. I wanna know.

91
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,960
Tell me the details! I want details!

92
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,259
Why you came so early today?

93
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,900
Oh. Lunch. You got a lunch date.

94
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,860
Hey! Su Xiao!

95
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,590

96
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,269
I miss you so much.

97
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,410
Me too.

98
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,530
It's a little cold today.

99
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,760
Don't you feel cold?

100
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,910
I'm alright. You know what?

101
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,839
I haven't caught a cold for years.

102
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,850
There is a secret.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,269
Secret? What's that?

104
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,920
Tell yourself that you can't get a cold
since you've piles of jobs to do.

105
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,110
If so...

106
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,250
You won't get a cold.

107
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:54,990
Seriously?

108
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,139
Definitely won't get a cold.

109
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,630
I've to keep telling myself

110
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,949
"I have no time to get ill,
I can't affect my work".

111
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,800
Then I really won't get a cold.

112
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,020
You're still stubborn.

113
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,360
