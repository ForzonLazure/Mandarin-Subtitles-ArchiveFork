=Episode 24=

31
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,550
It's really a super scheming role!

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,010
She was the heroine's bestie.

33
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,060
In order to get the trust of the heroine.

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,749
She asked someone
to hit against the heroine,

35
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,010
then went to save her.

36
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,779
Really a scheming drama queen. A bitch.

37
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,820
Brother, are you listening to me?

38
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,050
What's that look?

39
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,860
You look so happy.

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,480
When you talked about
playing a villain before,

41
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,620
you always looked upset.

42
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,180
How to say it.
Maybe I just figured it out.

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,620
Playing a villain also
brings me challenges and experience.

44
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,770
Have you been busy these days?

45
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,500
Not that busy.
I've been studying the script at home.

46
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,889
I can relax myself
coming out with you this time.

47
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:10,559
Really? I'm relieved then.

48
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,480
I think boss Song
must be satisfied with this role

49
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,440
when he reads the script.

50
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,850
He has been worried about this.

51
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,720
He asked me if you dislike him.

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,980
How could that be.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,410
He is very sensitive, you know.

54
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,490
Why he stays at our home every day?

55
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

56
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,130
This is your Chiffon cake set.

57
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,790
Caramel Macchiato!
I like it the most at this store!

58
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,380
You mentioned this
in your interview last time.

59
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,140
You even know that?

60
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,240
I'm your fan, you know.

61
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,590
Smells so good.
I haven't had this for long.

62
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,279
What's wrong?

63
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,800
Too hot. I accidentally choked.

64
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,500
Peeper.

65
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,360
Brother, I got coffee spilled on me.

66
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,200
I gotta go clean it up.

67
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,470
Something happened.

68
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,090
Hey. Come out.

69
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,400
What are you doing here?

70
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,880
That's my question for you, okay?

71
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,030
What are you doing here?

72
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,510
Dress like a freak.
Why hanging around here?

73
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,310
No one will recognize me
dressed like this.

74
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,880
Yep. But you may get caught.

75
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,210
Who is that man inside?

76
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,830
He is my...

77
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,030
Didn't I tell you to be careful
and behave yourself?

78
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Ah? What did I do?

79
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,320
Don't you remember
the photo of you dancing with Li Xiwei?

80
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,490
Why should you care?

81
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,070
It's my business where I want to be
and who I wanna be with!

82
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,170
You're with him?

83
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:57,910
What's wrong?

84
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,450
You've been in a relationship?

85
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,870
When did it start?

86
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,649
Why didn't Sandy tell me that?

87
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,930
What the hell are you bullshitting?

88
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,060
Who on earth is that man!

89
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,220
That sweet smile just now.

90
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,680
They can't just be friends!

91
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,029
Xiaoxiao. What're you doing out there?

92
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,990
He is the man inside with you?

93
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,850
Wai... Wait.

94
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,160
New face. Not an actor or a paparazzo.

95
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,740
He kept following Xiaoxiao,
dressed in such a strange way.

96
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,200
-Who the hell are you?
-Who the hell are you?

97
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,430
Easy, you two.

98
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,040
-What is he to you? -What is he to you?

99
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,080
=Sister protector VS Cat keeper=

100
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,290
Brother, he is not a bad guy.

101
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,000
Su Xiao is my sister.

102
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,790
This is my brother, Su Da.

103
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,050
Oh, you're Su Xiao's brother.

104
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,470
I am...

105
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,699
Wait a sec.

106
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,390
Look, they two...

107
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,630
Let get inside first.

108
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,810
You look so weird now.

109
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,850
Go back home first.

110
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,380
Wait...

111
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,610
What? You got snapped by a paparazzo?

112
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,860
You two?

113
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,290
No, three of us.

114
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,589
Who else?

115
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,540
He seems to be
the boss of a brokerage firm.

116
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,639
If you had told me earlier,
I would have greeted him.

117
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,070
But you just neglected me.

118
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,100
What happened then?

119
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,390
He went to get the paparazzo.

120
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,310
What a brisk boss.

121
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,130
See? All deleted.

122
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,270
I admire you.
You even called our chief editor.

123
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,319
Good for you.

124
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,790
Why did you follow Su Xiao?

125
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,990
It has been spread through the circle.

126
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,319
It's said she is after Li Xiwei's heart.

127
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,390
He'll make her popular.

128
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,550
Stay away from her
if you don't wanna get in trouble.

129
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,300
Thank god. Jianjian was with you.

130
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,730
I'm sorry for the trouble.

131
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,440
Those tabloids will make up a story
once they get some photos.

132
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,710
Even your family will get involved.

133
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,730
I lack of such experience.

134
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,290
Later you've to discuss with Sandy

135
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,770
before you wanna do something.

136
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,690
Okay.

137
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,960
=Xiao Jian=

138
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,840
I'll take care of it if anything happens.

139
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,880
Just focus on your drama.

140
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,170
You're capable enough
to play a role vividly.

141
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,480
Help me with the tripod.

142
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,720
Okay. Okay.

143
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,009
You go check this.

144
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,090
Gimme.

145
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,930
The work does not exist
to improve the image of the actor.

146
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,090
While the meaning of an actor is
to improve the quality of the work.

147
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,949
Since you're playing it, do it the best.

148
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,450
I'll exert all my efforts and do it best.

149
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,290
