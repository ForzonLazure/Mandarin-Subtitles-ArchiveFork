Yes. I can't believe she is such a person.

That's right. Don't know whether it's true or not.

Didn't you see the news online?

42
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,140
I saw it!

43
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,150
They knew that I did the flogging scene in person.

44
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,650
Many netizens praised me.

45

assistant director at night!

What's this!

48
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,779
They said this photo was taken last night,

49
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,780
and you got this role because of
your improper relationship with me!

50
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,579
The truth is you failed to take advantage of me!

51
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,160
Lower your voice, okay!

52
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,750
Why would such news...

53
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,380
Must be her!

54
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,550
Moreover, many members of our crew said

55
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,760
they heard strange sound coming from
the side of your room.

56
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,430
They all think that we two were...

57
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,730
What makes you so joyful!

58
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,060
You wanna die?

59
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,020
Do you want me to help you now?

60
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,850
So... Sorry.

61
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,860
Since last night,

62
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,690
has anyone approached you all of a sudden?

63
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,610
No... Nah.

64
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,820
Nobody came to me, either.

65
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,490
Anyhow, I cannot just bear this insult.

66
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,330
Really?

67
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,029
Liu Xuxu.

68
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,040
Su Xiao? You look spirited.

69
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,920
Did you go have fun this morning?

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,250
As expected, you did it.

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,130
What are you talking about? I can't get it.

72
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,920
Be quick to clear the air.

73
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,720
Why me?

74
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,890
Neglected it? Fine, hope you won't regret it.

75
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,350
Dear me! I'm so scared.

76
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,730
What can you do to make me regret?

77
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,480
I'd like to see that.

78
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,530
You'll screwed it up if director Xu knows this.

79
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,740
Bye-bye, just go back yourself.

80
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,590
Hey, don't gossip like that, okay?

81
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,920
Do you have any proof?

82
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:46,800
Yao Mengfang...

83
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,550
Su Xiao.

84
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,339
Sis Li Yan.

85
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,809
Thank you so much for last night.

86
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,640
How delicious the dishes you cooked for me!

87
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,980
Make it plausible.

88
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,440
Really sorry. I knew you got scenes to shoot today.

89
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,940
Yet kept you staying with me till this morning.

90
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,820
Never mind.

91
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,990
Ms. Li. So Ms. Su was with you this morning?

92
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,290
That's it. What's up?

93
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:15,554
Did you hear that?

94
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,249
Okay, have a break!

95
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,920
Sis Yan, thank you so much.

96
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,130
No big deal. I've been in this trade for long.

97
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,759
I've seen different kinds of crews and people.

98
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,139
Someone stabbed others
in the back in order to get a role.

99
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,770
Also someone tried to steal the show at any coast.

100
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,350
I... I really didn't do that.

101
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,980
I know that. You have Sandy with you.

102
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,730
I believe that you wouldn't do such a thing.

103
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,780
He also told me you're good at cooking.

104
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,410
I'll cook for you next time.

105
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,380
Just do it once. Only once.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,959
I can get the role then.

107
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,270
He saw me. No!

108
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,980
What a shame! It's over.

109
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,319
I'm clear that being an actress is not easy.

110
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,160
However,
it's hard to put on the clothes you take off.

111
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,120
Cherish yourself.

112
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,210
He helped me at the most important moment.

113
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,259
So, I want to help you.

114
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,840
What did you say?

115
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,050
Wasn't I supposed to be the endorser?

116
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,060
He clearly told me that he'd take me to see Mr. Wang.

117
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,422
What? He went back?
Then call him, or go to his company!

118
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,020
I can't leave my work, but can't you go?

119
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,044
Cut the crap!
You can go to hell if you can't get it for me!

120
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,290
Shoot.

121
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,466
Easy. A good conscience is not afraid of ghosts.

122
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,800
You know you look like a ghost?

123
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,088
No personal remark, okay?
I've something good for you.

124
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,300
What do you mean?

125
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,180
Would you like to listen to my favorite song?

126
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,139
Take it as a proof of us making peace.

127
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,270
No need. Can you get out of here?

128
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,230
You'll love it, trust me.

129
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,960
I love you so much! Stay with me, okay?

130
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,320
Why do you have this?

131
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,990
Not over yet.

132
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,740
Gimme!

133
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,330
This Mr. Lin is one of our investors, right?

134
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,200
I don't know! No more nonsense!

135
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,976
Maybe your voice is too loud,
maybe the room is not well insulated.

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,290
People in other rooms might
not tell whose voice this is.

137
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,670
But I heard it clearly living next door.

138
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,590
It's you who did such a shameless thing.
But you slandered me.

139
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,050
You...

140
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,720
You think you would get away with it?

141
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,930
If you stir up trouble again,

142
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,520
I'll post the audio file online.

143
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,980
Su Xiao, don't you think I can do nothing with you.

144
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,779
Give it a try then.
