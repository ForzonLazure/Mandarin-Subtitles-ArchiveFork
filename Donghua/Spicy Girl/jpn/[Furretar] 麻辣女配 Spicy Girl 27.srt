=Episode 27=

31
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,918
But I have to work today!

32
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,754
Su Xiao, how about you go there for me?

33
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:33,755
What?

34
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:36,007
Sis Yan, I don't think that will do.

35
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:37,801
How can I be that capable
to take over your job?

36
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,261
And you just suddenly...

37
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:40,600
Rest easy.

38
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,820
It's just a reality show.
You can totally do it.

39
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:44,933
A reality show?

40
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:46,767
Yes, called the Sprint Partners.

41
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:50,355
Isn't it quite popular lately?

42
00:01:50,355 --> 00:01:52,523
And the guests are all super stars?

43
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:53,984
Just take it easy.

44
00:01:53,984 --> 00:01:56,140
I've informed the organizer.
It'll be all right.

45
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,080
Yeah, but I...

46
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:58,570
I feel so dizzy now.

47
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:00,323
Bye-bye.

48
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:02,534
Sis Yan, wait, wait, wait.

49
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,164
Su Xiao, I think it could be

50
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:08,790
a very good opportunity for you.

51
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,209
That makes sense.

52
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:12,002
But I...

53
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:12,878
Of course,

54
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:14,630
you're the one to make the call.

55
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:17,720
Alright!

56
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,369
It's just to play a game.

57
00:02:20,427 --> 00:02:21,860
Sis Yan finally asked me to help.

58
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:25,040
Then I can go to give them a reply.

59
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:26,160
Okay.

60
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:29,620
Your partner in the program
would be Xiao Jian.

61
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:35,100
Why him again?!

62
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:42,699
For this program,

63
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:45,070
I have to remind you of
something very important.

64
00:02:45,744 --> 00:02:47,880
Because I'm your broker.

65
00:02:48,163 --> 00:02:50,915
So it's not strange for you
to have known Xiao Jian.

66
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,300
Everyone could think of this point.

67
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:54,710
Brother Wu's side also know it.

68
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:56,010
Yes.

69
00:02:56,338 --> 00:02:57,380
Nevertheless,

70
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,715
people usually would think

71
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:00,500
that you two are just boss and employee.

72
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:04,220
If you get along like
you do at home before cameras,

73
00:03:04,221 --> 00:03:06,450
the audience will
be suspicious of your relations.

74
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:09,570
It's indeed hard to be explained.

75
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:11,895
So during the progress of shooting,

76
00:03:11,937 --> 00:03:14,869
you two have to pretend
to be not so familiar.

77
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:17,680
So it'll also be a test to my acting.

78
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:19,361
Besides, we just had a fight.

79
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:21,149
This feels so awkward.

80
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:33,399
How should I greet him?

81
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,140
Calm down. Calm down.

82
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,710
Time to show my acting skills.

83
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:38,590
I can do this!

84
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:41,690
Su Xiao.

85
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:43,009
Long time no see.

86
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:43,970
Let's go for it.

87
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,820
Long... Long time no see.

88
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:54,330
Hi, Xiao Jian and Su Xiao.

89
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:56,420
I'm Kong Xinyi, this program's director.

90
00:03:56,648 --> 00:03:58,692
It's you two's first time
to join our program?

91
00:03:58,692 --> 00:03:59,985
Hope that it'll be a good cooperation.

92
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:02,028
Yes, good... good cooperation.

93
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:03,080
Good cooperation.

94
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:06,320
Well, I think you must
be unfamiliar to each other?

95
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:16,700
Yes.

96
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:18,999
What a coincidence, meet you here again.

97
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:21,230
Mr. Li is here.

98
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,600
Why is he also here?!

99
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:25,620
Isn't this Li Xiwei?

100
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:26,490
Long time no see.

101
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:29,130
Didn't we just meet each other?

102
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:30,480
I don't think so.

103
00:04:30,557 --> 00:04:33,009
Did you mistake someone else for me?

104
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:34,351
Did I?

105
00:04:34,352 --> 00:04:35,896
I don't think my memory is that bad.

106
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,898
I've heard that
your company's business volume

107
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:39,420
has been increasing lately.

108
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:41,530
So you're too busy to remember it.

109
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:43,194
Mr. Xiao, I'm flattered.

110
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:45,155
You're concerned about my company?

111
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,550
Director, there's something
needs you to confirm.

112
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:48,760
Oh, coming.

113
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:50,800
Sorry, I have to go now.

114
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:54,430
Now you can tell the truth?

115
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:57,000
Your relationship needs
to be kept a secret?

116
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,009
Because it's her first time
in a variety show.

117
00:04:59,544 --> 00:05:02,070
We don't want some strange topics
to come out of it.

118
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:03,820
Thank you, Mr. Li.

119
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,759
I see.

120
00:05:07,218 --> 00:05:09,220
So you owe me one this time.

121
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,800
It's so mentally tiring to
take part in a program.

122
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:15,769
Now, let's begin
our first section of the game!

123
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:17,670
Barrier Basketball!

124
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:19,773
The girl in one's team has to

125
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:21,983
pass through the barriers
with the basketball

126
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:23,526
and get to the boy under the hoop,

127
00:05:23,568 --> 00:05:24,903
and then give it to the boy

128
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:26,571
within the required time.

129
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:29,880
If the boy makes his shot,
they'll get 10 scores.

130
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:33,430
If the girl sinks a shot directly,
that's 15 scores!

131
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:36,600
Let's start with
the Blue team of Xiao Jian&Su Xiao.

132
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:39,542
A national star and
an imposing rising actress!

133
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:41,836
What kind of performance
will they show us?

134
00:05:41,836 --> 00:05:43,797
Let's wait and see!

135
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:45,048
So embarrassing.

136
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:46,850
If it keeps going like this...

137
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:48,579
I have to...

138
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:52,519
Congratulate the Blue team,
they're the champion!

139
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:54,820
Good job, you made this happen.

140
00:05:55,642 --> 00:05:56,976
I'm sorry for what happened last time.

141
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:58,560
Let's both forget about it.

142
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,090
I have to win!

143
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:05,170
You'll all know how awesome I am!

144
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:08,910
Ready?

145
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:21,060
Su Xiao, pass the ball.

146
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:22,750
I got this!

147
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:32,319
Done!

148
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:33,680
So fast!

149
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:34,889
Just a blink of an eye,

150
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:37,910
Su Xiao has completed
the entire game by herself!

151
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,120
They got 15 scores!

152
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,110
No, so horrible.

153
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,900
I'm falling off this...

154
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,740
We're the champion!

155
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,940
The first section ends now.

156
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,115
Xiao Jian and Su Xiao's team
gets a perfect 15-score.

157
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:53,970
=Blue Team 15, Purple Team 00=
While other two teams

158
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,640
=Green Team 00=
get 0 score due to timeout.

159
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,710
Didn't expect that the gap would
be so huge since the first section.

160
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,589
-What would happen in the game later?
-Let's get together to next task venue!

161
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,509
Please stay with us.

162
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,580
-After the ads... -What do you say?

163
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,660
We'll see it together!

164
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,260
Come with me.

165
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,421
What's wrong?

166
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,297
=No. 8 Warehouse=

167
00:07:07,338 --> 00:07:08,400
What were you doing?

168
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,440
You tried so hard,
thinking you're above anyone else?

169
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,550
Have you ever seen a variety show before?

170
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:14,569
I... I have.

171
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:16,300
You've seen how others performed?

172
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:17,848
How?

173
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:19,800
They're all so clumsy.

174
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:23,060
An entertainment show
is made to help people relax.

175
00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:25,170
Those barriers are
set to cause funny effects.

176
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:26,880
You thought you're in the Olympics?

177
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,889
And you finished the task so fast.

178
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,160
There won't be
a shot of you during the final editing.

179
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,534
I worked hard to finish my job,
anything wrong about that?

180
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:37,730
You did it wrong.

181
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:39,204
The purpose of a variety show

182
00:07:39,204 --> 00:07:41,970
is that the audience
find it interesting and funny.

183
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:44,140
It's not like competitive sports.

184
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:45,000
Your job is

but we can't...

188
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:53,384
It should be in this warehouse.

00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:54,134
Hurry.

190
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:55,011
Where is it?

191
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:55,900
I didn't see it.

192
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,950
So odd. It might be inside there.

193
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,110
Hurry up, or we'll be scolded again.

194
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:02,780
Yes, it happened last time.
