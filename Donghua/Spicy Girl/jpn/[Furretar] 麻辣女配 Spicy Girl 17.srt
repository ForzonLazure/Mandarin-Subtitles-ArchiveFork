31
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,290
Su Xiao,
how have you been doing these days?

32
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,139
Have you got any troubles?

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,590
I'm all fine these days.

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,220
Who the hell started the rumor last time?

35
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,280
Did you find that?

36
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,460
If you stir up trouble again,

37
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,029
I'll post the audio file online.

38
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,380
It doesn't matter who did that.

39
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,220
I promised you I would
cook you a rich meal, that matters.

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,340
I'm starving.

41
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,810
Wow! It's just like the
level of a five-star chef!

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,460
I'm just fond of cooking.

43
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,730
When I eat something delicious outside,

44
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,700
I'd try to cook it at home.

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,070
I gotta take a photo and share in Moments.

46
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,120
What a pity! Sandy didn't come today.

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,670
Speaking of this,
we haven't seen him for days.

48
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,110
That's it.

49
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,160
He told me he's looking into something.

50
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,320
Don't know what's going on.

51
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,930
I heard that he was going to
see Xiao Jian.

52
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,910
What the hell are they doing so covertly?

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,760
I mean they're planning something good.

54
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,720
Well, guys! Cheers!

55
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,810
Cheers!

56
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,140
Enjoy yourselves!

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,570
It's so tasty!

58
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,870
Ms. Su Xiao!
What fabulous cooking skills you have!

59
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,090
-So palatable! -Yep! So delicious!

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,730
Well, it seems they recognize
my cooking skills more than my acting.

61
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,950
Nice! I finally repaid sis Yan the favor.

62
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,000
Sandy?

63
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,320
Su Xiao,
I've something important to tell you.

64
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,630
Okay, it's done.

65
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:36,910
Thank you.

66
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,860
You're gonna finish your scenes today.

67
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,300
I'll miss you.

68
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:44,929
Ms. Su.

69
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,560
May I be your personal assistant?

70
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,680
I really, really admire
your acting skills!

71
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,920
I wanna be with you in the future!

72
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,400
Thank you for your kindness.

73
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,410
But, sorry, I can't accept that.

74
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,480
I would never keep one around me

75
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,619
who is always ready to betray me.

76
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,990
Su Xiao,
I've something important to tell you.

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,869
These days,
I've asked someone to look into

78
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:18,490
the source of those candid photos online.

79
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,210
Didn't Liu Xuxu do that?

80
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,460
Yes. She did spread the photos.

81
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,460
But those photos
were taken by someone else.

82
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,370
It's your makeup assistant, Yao Mengfang.

83
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,300
Yao Mengfang, have I ever offended you?

84
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,319
You must take it wrong!

85
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,620
How could I...

86
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,779
Take it wrong?

87
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,890
You mean I've wronged you?

88
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,810
Liu Xuxu.

89
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,759
She asked you to do this, right?

90
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,970
She said I would get a large sum of money

91
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,790
if I just took some photos.

92
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,710
I don't have a regular work.

93
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,020
And I've to pay for all the makeup tools.

94
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,200
Sometimes, I can hardly
find a crew to follow.

95
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,200
Thus, I even can't afford my rent.

96
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,840
At first, I refused her.

97
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,930
Later, she told me this
can also hype the film up.

98
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,350
It might also do you some good!

99
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,890
And you would accept this.

100
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,190
Not me. It does you some good.

101
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,640
I'm sorry, I know I did wrong.

102
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,800
You think I'm going to
let you off the hook

103
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,510
by making such a casual apology?

104
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,210
Forget it!

105
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:42,959
What?

106
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,800
You must be kidding, right?

107
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,509
Do you think I'm just kidding?

108
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,780
It's settled.

109
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,490
No more preferential treatment for Liu Xuxu.

110
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,650
Would it work?
She has a big investor backing her up.

111
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,620
So what? I'm Li Xiwei,
I can choose whoever I want.

112
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,680
Who dares to say no?

113
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,780
Besides, that may not
be a bad thing for her.

114
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,730
Well, Mr. Li, may I ask...

115
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,370
Do you pay your attention to someone else?

116
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,340
What kind of person is that?

117
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,230
Good question.

118
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,950
That's what I wanna know.

119
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,910
You think I'm going to
let you off the hook

120
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,730
by making such a casual apology?

121
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,010
If I make the things
you've done known to everyone,

122
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,449
can you find a place
to stay in this industry?

123
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,730
Will you get another job?

124
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,110
It's terrible, isn't it?

125
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,870
You did get the benefit for now,

126
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,200
but you may also ruin your career.

127
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,149
I can keep it a secret this time.

128
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,110
But, Yao Mengfang,
I hope you can get a lesson from it.

129
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,480
You can easily
find a chance in the showbiz

130
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,270
to gain something
by harming others' interests.

131
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,370
If you only think a lot of
the petty benefits at the moment,

132
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,660
you may lose the thing
that can never be retrieved.

133
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,069
Don't even think about
being my personal assistant.

134
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,780
If you do such a thing again,

135
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,250
I'll let everyone know what you've done.

136
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,550
I'm terribly sorry.

137
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,060
I won't do that anymore.

138
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,430
Behave yourself.

139
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,650
Xiaoxiao. You still chose to spare her.

140
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,420
Or else? After all,
she's not the prime plotter.

141
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,410
You may meet a lot of
"Liu Xuxu" in the future.

142
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,279
I'm not afraid at all.

143
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,350
