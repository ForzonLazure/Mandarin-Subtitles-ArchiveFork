31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,853
Alright, finally it's the last section
of today's Sprint Partners.

32
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:34,506
Looking for Coconuts!

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,133
This game requires all the players
to enter the coast snack street

34
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:42,333
to find coconuts with your team mark
on it from the stalls.

35
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,253
Every team has five coconuts to find out.

36
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:48,080
The team that collects all the coconuts
and comes back the fastest wins.

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,079
But the stall owners might not
hand out the coconuts at once.

38
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,060
So players must complete
the tasks they assigned

39
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,860
as soon as possible to get the coconuts.

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,585
What's more,
the winner will get 100 scores!

41
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,940
So even the team that lags behind

42
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,560
could take this chance
to make a turnaround!

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,493
Go for it, everyone.

44
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,889
So the previous scores would be useless...

45
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:07,373
That's why we call it a variety show.

46
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,480
So, game starts now!

47
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:13,920
Three, two, one!

48
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,180
We're going to find star marks.

49
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,800
Let's start from nearby.

50
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,480
Okay, there's a stall ahead.
Let's go take a look.

51
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,119
Here you are.

52
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:26,586
Looks so delicious.

53
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:30,520
Hi, do you have any coconut
with a star mark on it?

54
00:02:30,986 --> 00:02:32,026
Good luck for you.

55
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:33,160
I suppose it's here?

56
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,253
Yes, it is.

57
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:35,760
Can you give it to us?

58
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,693
Yes, I can.

59
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:39,679
But there's a condition.

60
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,226
Aren't you actors? Give me a play first.

61
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,345
A piece of cake.

62
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:44,533
What play is it?

63
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,280
You'll play a cat fairy.

64
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,293
And you'll play a Taoist to catch her.

65
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Well, could it be something else?

66
00:02:53,026 --> 00:02:53,505
No.

67
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,133
I just want to see
Taoist catching cat fairy.

68
00:02:58,533 --> 00:02:59,493
Just to play a cat, okay?

69
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:04,200
I can play anything else
for you but not this!

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,186
Give me the coconut now!

71
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:09,426
Sorry, your coconut, please spare my life.

72
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,800
Su Xiao is so interesting.

73
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:15,813
Didn't expect
it's so helpful to be scary-looking.

74
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:19,653
Next, leave it to me.

75
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:23,413
I'm expecting you
have better means to get coconuts.

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,786
Do you have any coconut
with a star mark on it?

77
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:27,666
Yes, here it is.

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,586
Thank you.

79
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:33,786
But the program
asked me not to tell you that

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,853
the fruit stall next door,

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,506
the dessert shop ahead

82
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,240
and the stuffed bun shop
all have your coconuts.

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,546
Thank you very much.

84
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:44,146
And please take this and eat it.

85
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,413
Well, you finished the task so fast.

86
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:50,586
The fans are so enthusiastic.

87
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,413
Neither of other two teams
has found three coconuts yet.

88
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:53,400
Indeed.

89
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,613
It's also troublesome to be so popular.

90
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:58,413
Where did you get so many donuts?

91
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,653
The stall owner over there gave it to us.

92
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:03,226
She told us to eat it.

93
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:09,600
Will this affect this program's effects?

94
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,653
Maybe, more or less.

95
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:12,613
Makes sense.

96
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,866
You two.

97
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:14,320
Um?

98
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:16,346
You still haven't finished the task.

99
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,960
What?

100
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:21,199
Just now,
when the stall owner gave you the coconut,

101
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:23,853
she told you to eat the donuts, right?

102
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:30,346
So eating up the donuts is
the premise for you to get the coconuts.

103
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:33,453
But you haven't. So your task is still on.

104
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
So yummy.

105
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:37,493
Mine too.

106
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,946
Each one has a unique flavor.

107
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,573
Really? Let me try yours.

108
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:41,880
Aren't you too greedy?

109
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,186
Eat yours up first.

110
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,306
This tastes good, too.

111
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:47,946
You greedy kitten!

112
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:54,213
Yummy. Yours tastes good, too.

113
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,400
But it seems as natural as it was.

114
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:07,000
What's going on between them?
The vibe seems good.

115
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:09,066
This tastes good, too.

116
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,319
Yes. I can eat so much more.

117
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:15,920
Help, I'm so full now.

118
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,853
Me too.

119
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,466
I can't eat any more.

120
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,800
Only two left, come on.

121
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,973
Now, let's see the final rankings.

122
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,266
The last place of the Sprint Partners is

123
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,213
the Blue team of Xiao Jian and Su Xiao!

124
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:38,786
I'm gonna throw up.

125
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:39,865
Me too.

126
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,520
The punishment for them is,

127
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,860
a two-day survival test

128
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,550
on a desert island starting from tomorrow.

129
00:05:52,946 --> 00:05:54,520
As the last section of our program,

130
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,430
you two are gonna withstand

131
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,180
a two-day survival test
on a desert island.

132
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,280
Filming equipment has been set up there.

133
00:06:00,506 --> 00:06:02,986
We'll watch your moves
on another island nearby.

134
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:05,133
Could there be any problems?

135
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,812
Don't worry,
everything has been arranged well.

136
00:06:08,226 --> 00:06:09,600
There's no dangerous animals
on the island.

137
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,330
The food supply is sufficient.

138
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,530
And they'll take all the necessary tools.

139
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:16,520
And we've set many secret cameras

140
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:19,360
to monitor them from 360-degree.

141
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,400
Don't worry.

142
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:22,773
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

143
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:25,400
It's okay, Sandy.

144
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:27,906
We're expecting
you two's brilliant performance.

145
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,013
Okay, we'll try our best.

146
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:33,693
Anything wrong?

147
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:36,693
Nothing.

148
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:40,413
So, target at the desert land, set out!

149
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:48,680
No one is here, as they said.

150
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,426
Where the cameras could be?

151
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,866
What the hell.

152
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:53,986
Watch your tongue.

153
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:56,453
A drone just flew by.

154
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:58,493
And we both have sound recorders on us.

155
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:02,506
Anyway, let's start probing this island.

156
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:04,493
Okay, good luck.

157
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:17,760
Here's a cave.

158
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:18,680
Be careful.

159
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:21,400
There might be cameras here.

160
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,706
Anyway, we can't be more careful.

161
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,906
After a tour,
I think this island is not big.

162
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:29,546
What should we do next?

163
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:31,160
It's almost dark.

164
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:33,680
I think it's time to
get prepared for the night.

165
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:35,680
Prepare for the night?

166
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:38,026
Su Xiao, could you come up here
and give me a hand?

167
00:07:38,546 --> 00:07:39,080
Okay.

168
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:43,266
Well...

169
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Although it's a program being filmed,

170
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,586
I still feel panic
if he and I have to stay here

171
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,226
